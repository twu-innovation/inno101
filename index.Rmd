### Course Technologies{-}

This course is about learning with technology. Digital literacies are closely linked but not limited to digital skills. Consequently, this course will use a number of different online communication and publishing technologies to support your learning.

#### An open philosophy of inclusion {-}

Learning with Technology incorporates a wide range of online technologies and software applications. In this course we want to promote free and open source software because we believe that no learner should be denied access to learning for lack of funds to purchase a proprietary software license.  Nor do we believe that you should be forced to sacrifice your freedoms in software choice.

The course resources and interaction technologies are based entirely on free and open source software and you will be able to complete all the learning activities using open source applications without the need to purchase any software. You are free to use proprietary technology applications of your choice, but you can also use this course to explore and experiment with open technology.

#### Summary of technologies used on this course {-}

The following table provides a summary of the main technologies used in this course.

  |

| Litmaps | Litmaps is a web app that you can use to discover and manage resources. In this course you will use Litmaps to build a map of the literature related to topics you want to research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Hypothes.is | We use [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/), an open source web-service that enables users to annotate, discuss and share reflections on web site pages on the Internet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| WordPress          | In Unit 4 we introduce WordPress, a free, open-source platoform used to create websites and blogs. Learners are invited to establish their own **personal course blog**. In this way you will retain control over your own data even when the course is finished.  We recommend WordPress as this tool is supported by TWU, but you may use a blogging platform of your choice.                                                                               |
| Zoom                 | Zoom is a communications platform that allows you to connect via video, audio, phone, or chat. Note the GX Live sessions may use Zoom for the Learning Lab sessions. GX Prime students are encouraged to take advantage of the Learning Hub, which will have weekly Zoom meetings as well.                                                                                                                    |

<!--

| Course feed          | The [Course feed](https://course.oeru.org/lida101/interactions/course-feed) is a unique feature of OERu courses. Course comments and posts tagged with the course code (LiDA101) on the course forums, your course blog, the resource bank, our social network and [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) will be harvested and incorporated into the live course feed. This is the hub for keeping track of the distributed course interactions on the web. |
| Course resource bank | The [resource bank](https://bookmarks.oeru.org/search.php/all/lida101) is a site used to share web links and summaries of useful resources you find online. We encourage learners to share links publicly with your peers. Remember to vote for links you find useful on the site. Search using the course tag: “LDRS101”   

-->


#### Learn by Doing {-}

Some learners will be familiar with these technologies, while others will be using them for the first time. We use a learn by doing approach and you will be prompted in the course materials when to interact with these different technologies.

Initially the use of different technologies distributed on the web may be confusing. However, this is a course about learning on the Internet and once you have completed this course, you will become a competent user of these online technologies.

Have fun and enjoy the learning experience!
