## Sharing Learning at TWU

Community is an essential component of Trinity Western University.  Just have a look at the [TWU website](https://www.twu.ca/){target="_blank"} and you will find several references to learning within a community.  For example,  

> "At Trinity Western University, you'll experience an authentic and engaging community as you enrich your understanding of the world—preparing for a life of faithful engagement in your community and profession. We are deeply committed to providing a transformational education, where you will develop practical professional skills while exploring bigger ideas about who you are, what you believe, and what you're called to do in the world." [TWU website](https://www.twu.ca/){target="_blank"}

Why is community so important to TWU, and how does it help us learn?  Have a quick read of [TWU's Core Values](https://www.twu.ca/about-us/commitments/core-values){target="_blank"}.  At this point in the course, we hope you have taken full advantage of the online community and have personal examples of how these interactions have impacted you.

As for learning...how does sharing our learning within a community help us achieve our personal and professional goals? 

There are several social learning theories and practicies that explain how social interactions impact our learning (e.g. Situated Learning, Social Constructivism, Connectivism, Cooperative and Collaborative Learning, Communities of Inquiry, etc.) If you're interested, feel free to look up these terms online or use tools, such as LitMaps.  

In this course we have promoted the use of tools that allow you to share your learning online: Discourse, Hypothes.is, and WordPress.  Our goal is to help you utilize technology to discover and share knowledge, collaborate with others, and become engaged digital global citizens.  In the next activity, we ask you to reflect on your learning experiences and your goals.

```


### Technology and Change {-}

Throughout history, there are technologies which have influenced change in society. Consider for example, the invention of the steam engine and its contribution to the Industrial Revolution. In more recent times, the advent of digital photography displaced Kodachrome (at one time, the market leader in colour film sales) which ceased production in 2009.

```

### Artificial Intelligence {-}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to have a significant impact on society and business. Examples include, autonomous cars, computers understanding human speech and machine learning. Consider for instance, that computer chess games available for commercial desktop machines have the ability to beat accomplished chess players including grand masters.  And of course, Chat GPT.  

In this section we introduce a few interesting examples of artificial intelligence to provide a sense of how sophisticated these technologies are becoming.

First, let's define AI:

> "The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages" ([Oxford Reference](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095426960){target="_blank"})

> "The capacity of a computer to perform operations analogous to learning and decision making in humans, as by an expert system, a program for CAD or CAM, or a program for the perception and recognition of shapes in computer vision systems" ([Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/artificial-intelligence){target="_blank"})

What is your experience with AI?  Have you used an AI tool, such as Grammerly or ChatGPT? How has this technology affected you as a student, and what effect do you think it has/will have on your chosen profession?  

In the next activity, we'll explore some of these questions and concerns.


### Activity: How Can I Use AI as a Student? {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

First, do a quick search online for AI tools for university students. 
Examples:  
- [How can AI be used by university students?](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/advice/how-can-ai-be-used-university-students){target="_blank"}    
- [The 10 Best AI Tools to Help Students Learn Faster](https://mystudylife.com/10-best-ai-tools-to-help-students-learn-faster/){target="_blank"}    

Intrigued? Do you find any tech tools that would be useful in understanding course topics, studying, generating flashcards, transcribing lectures and voice notes, correcting grammar, writing an essay, creating a slideshow presentation, drafting a forum discussion post, etc.?

Do any of these capabilites concern you?  Do you think they concern your professors or fellow students? 

Review TWU's policy on [Academic Misconduct & Fraud](https://www.twu.ca/about-us/policies-guidelines/university-policies/academic-misconduct-fraud){target="_blank"}.   Is it Academic Fraud if you use Chat GPT to complete assignments?  

Search online for key words related to this issue, such as "university concern policy artificial intelligence" and you will find numerous articles on the use of AI in universities, as well as emerging policies.  For example, the University of Toronto's guidelines for [ChatGPT and Generative AI in the Classroom](https://www.viceprovostundergrad.utoronto.ca/strategic-priorities/digital-learning/special-initiative-artificial-intelligence/){target="_blank"}

Here are some guidelines you may receive from your instructors at TWU:

• Students are encouraged to make use of technology, including generative artificial intelligence
tools, to contribute to their understanding of course materials.
• Students must submit, as an appendix with their assignments, any content produced by an
artificial intelligence tool, and the prompt used to generate the content.
• Any content produced by an artificial intelligence tool must be cited appropriately. Many
organizations that publish standard citation formats are now providing information on citing
generative AI (e.g., MLA: https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/){target="_blank"}.  
• Students may use artificial intelligence tools for creating an outline for an assignment, but the
final submitted assignment must be original work produced by the individual student alone.  
• Students may not use artificial intelligence tools for taking tests, writing research papers,
creating computer code, or completing major course assignments. However, these tools may be
useful when gathering information from across sources and assimilating it for understanding.  

If you have any question about the use of AI applications for course work, please speak with your instructor.

Consider your chosen field of study.  How can AI benefit your industry?  Are there any concerns regarding how AI might be used?

```

### Activity: The Price of AI {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this topic we've explored AI - it's possiblities for study and careers, and some concerns about using AI.  This activity focuses on how AI moderates harmful content.  How does AI know what is harmful? Since AI tools are built on all kinds of information, including harmful and hateful content, how is this content identified?  

AI systems require lots of work from humans to function correctly. A 2023 report from Time magazine showed that people in Kenya were paid poverty wages to build a safety system into ChatGPT. Since the platform was fed data from various places sometimes it would make racist or abusive remarks. To build a safeguard into the system, workers were exposed to vile and offensive web content in order to tag it so that the platform could eventually recognize offensive speech all on its own. A large portion of this content was very traumatic, and workers interviewed said they were mentally scarred from the work.

Read the following articles: 

- [OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour to Make ChatGPT Less Toxic](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/) by Billy Perrigo published in Time (January 18, 2023).
- [Inside Facebook's African Sweatshop](https://time.com/6147458/facebook-africa-content-moderation-employee-treatment/) by Billy Perrigo published in Time (Feburary 14, 2020).

Finally, watch the video, [Doing Grueling Work for an AI: Data Labeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug_p2wHhla0)


<div class ="video-container">

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ug_p2wHhla0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> 

</div>

**Questions to Consider**:

- Is it ethical to submit those Kenyan workers to trauma in order to sanitize ChatGPT for other users? 
- What other solutions are there for training AI to moderate content? 

Share you thoughts on AI by posting a comment on Discourse, for example:

- AI will ...  
- I was surprised that AI ...  
- In <insert business> AI will ...  

```



## Societal Issues and the Internet

### Website Tracking

Website tracking is the practice of collecting data about a user's online activities when they visit websites or use web services. This data is gathered primarily for marketing and analytical purposes, allowing website owners, advertisers, and service providers to better understand user behavior, tailor their services, and deliver targeted content and advertisements. Before we delve into the details of web tracking, watch the video below.

<details>
<summary>**How does website tracking work?**</summary>  

**Cookies**: Cookies are small text files that websites store on your device. They contain information about your online activities, such as login credentials, preferences, and browsing history. Websites use cookies to recognize and remember you when you return, and they can also track your movements across the site.

**IP Address Tracking**: Every device connected to the internet has a unique IP address. Websites can log and analyze these addresses to determine a user's approximate location and to track their visits.

**Analytics Tools**: Many websites use analytics tools like Google Analytics to monitor user behavior. These tools track which pages you visit, how long you stay on each page, and how you arrived at the website (e.g., through a search engine or a referral from another site). This data helps website owners optimize their content and user experience.

**Ad Trackers**: Advertisers and ad networks use various techniques to track your online behavior. They place cookies on your device, which allows them to follow your movements across multiple websites. This data is used to deliver personalized ads based on your interests and browsing history.

**Social Media Widgets**: Social media buttons and widgets on websites can track your activity, even if you don't click on them. They often use this information to build a profile of your interests and habits.

**Fingerprinting**: Fingerprinting is a technique that collects data about your device and browser configuration, such as your screen resolution, installed fonts, and plugins. This information can be used to create a unique identifier for your device and track your online activities.

**Location Data**: Many websites request access to your device's location information. This can be used to provide location-based services, but it also allows websites to track your physical movements.

**Data Brokers**: Your data may be collected, aggregated, and sold to data brokers who build detailed profiles about individuals. These profiles can include your demographic information, interests, and online behavior.

**Personalization**: Websites and online services use the data they collect to personalize your experience. For example, they may recommend products, content, or services based on your browsing history and preferences.

**Targeted Advertising**: Advertisers use your data to show you ads that are more likely to be relevant to your interests. This is how you might see ads for products you've recently searched for online.

**Analytics and Optimization**: Website owners use tracking data to improve their websites and services, making them more user-friendly and effective.

**Market Research**: Aggregated user data is often used for market research and to identify trends and consumer preferences.

**Data Profiling**: Your data may be used to build detailed profiles about you. These profiles can be used for a variety of purposes, including credit scoring, job recruiting, and targeted marketing.

**Security and Fraud Prevention**: Tracking data can also be used for security purposes, helping to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.

<summary>**What are the privacy concerns?**</summary>  

Privacy concerns regarding website tracking primarily revolve around the collection and use of personal data without the explicit consent of users. Here are some key privacy concerns and ways in which users can protect themselves from tracking:

**Invasion of Privacy**: Website tracking can create a detailed profile of an individual's online behavior, which may include sensitive information such as health concerns, financial status, or personal interests. This can be seen as an invasion of privacy.

**Data Breaches**: When your data is collected and stored by multiple parties, there is an increased risk of data breaches. If a hacker gains access to a company's database that stores user data, your personal information may be exposed.

**Targeted Advertising**: While some users appreciate personalized ads, others find them intrusive and a form of manipulation. The extensive tracking of online behavior allows advertisers to deliver highly targeted ads, which can feel invasive.

**Third-Party Sharing**: Data collected by websites is often shared with third-party companies, including data brokers and ad networks. Users may not be aware of who has access to their data and how it's used.

</details>
<details>
<summary>**How can I protect myself from tracking?**</summary>  

**Use Privacy-Focused Browsers**: Consider using web browsers that prioritize user privacy, such as Mozilla Firefox or the Tor Browser. These browsers often include built-in tracking protection features.

**Browser Extensions**: Install browser extensions or add-ons like uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, and HTTPS Everywhere, which can block tracking cookies, scripts, and enhance your online security.

**Opt-Out Options**: Some websites and advertising networks provide options to opt out of personalized ads. You can often find these settings in the privacy sections of websites or through industry-specific opt-out platforms, like the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).

**Use a VPN**: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can hide your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic, making it more challenging for websites to track your location and online activities.

**Cookie Settings**: Adjust your browser's cookie settings to block third-party cookies. You can choose to accept cookies only from visited websites, which limits tracking across different sites.

**Use Private Browsing Modes**: Most browsers offer private or incognito modes that don't store your browsing history or cookies. While this doesn't provide complete anonymity, it limits tracking to a single session.

**Search Engines**: Consider using privacy-focused search engines like DuckDuckGo or Startpage, which do not track your search queries.

**Review App Permissions**: On mobile devices, review and restrict the permissions granted to apps, including location access. Some apps collect more data than necessary for their core functionality.

**Regularly Clear Cookies**: Periodically clear your browser's cookies and browsing history to remove tracking data that has been collected over time.

**Educate Yourself**: Stay informed about online privacy and data protection practices. Understand the privacy policies of websites and services you use, and be cautious about sharing personal information online.

**Consider VPNs and Encrypted Messaging**: For heightened privacy, use end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal and consider using a reputable VPN service to protect your online communication.

It's important to note that while these steps can help reduce online tracking, they may not completely eliminate it. Achieving complete anonymity on the internet is challenging, but these measures can significantly enhance your online privacy and data security. Additionally, privacy laws and regulations in your region may provide you with rights and options for controlling how your data is collected and used online.

### Activity: Forum: Philanthropy and Corporate Advertising  {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Next, let's explore and reflect on the relationship between corporate commercial interests and digital citizenship for learning in a digital age.

Read the following case study:

The [OERu](https://oeru.org/){target="_blank"} is a charitable organisation which provides open online courses for free, using open educational resources which any educational institution can adopt, modify and reuse. There are costs that need to be covered to sustain the OERu: for example, the assembly of open online courses, hosting of the server and software infrastructure, staff to coordinate and support the initiative. etc. The OERu does not generate any revenue from corporate services, by, for example, allowing advertising on the OERu course sites for a share of the advertising revenue. Moreover, the OERu does not sell or generate revenue from personal data learners provide by using these free learning services, therefore users are not the product of this service.   

**Discussion**

Join the discussion on philanthropy and corporate advertising. The key question is how can non-profit organisations sustain free educational services for those who can’t afford traditional education provision?

Consider the following issues:

- As a learner, how would you feel if the course materials included corporate advertising? If advertising were to be supported, how would you feel if the OERu course sites required you to switch off any ad-blockers before gaining access to the course materials?  
- Is it appropriate for publicly funded institutions and charities working in education to generate revenue from corporate advertising to support and sustain free online services? What are the risks and opportunities?    
- Should education institutions and educational charities accept significant corporate sponsorship in return for profiling proprietary products?  
- The OERu has recommended that learners use free blogging services to share their learning outputs. Many of these services carry advertising. How do you feel about using these services – being the product rather than consumer? Would it be better for OERu to recommend that learners use a paid service without advertising? How would this impact on learners who do not have sufficient funds to afford maintaining a domain of their own?  
- Other?

### Online Impersonation 

Impersonation online refers to the act of creating an online presence in someone else’s name. This is potentially a complex issue as some social media sites permit parody accounts or accounts that are intended to represent real individuals. It is not necessarily illegal to impersonate someone per se, for example comedy, but online impersonation is a growing problem. Many social media sites have anti-impersonation policies, but this is not sufficient guarantee or protection against the risks of online impersonation.


### Activity: Identify the Imposter!  {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Visit the profile page of following X (Twitter) accounts:

- [Nelson Mandela](https://twitter.com/NelsonMandela){target="_blank"}  
- [Mark Zuckerburg](https://twitter.com/notzuckerberg){target="_blank"}
- [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/ElonMuskAOC){target="_blank"}
- [Darth Vader](https://twitter.com/DarthVader){target="_blank"}

Clearly these social media accounts are not the “real” people. In one case it’s a foundation promoting the legacy of Nelson Mandela, the next two examples are parody accounts of two tech giants, and the last example is, well, Darth Vader!
 

Read the following articles on the social media response to impersonation:

Have you seen a fake account on social media? What clues did you have that it was not real?  

```

```{block, type='feedback'}

Sidenote: If interested, search on X for some parody accounts.  Some can be quite entertaining, but you might notice that other accounts simply mock the person they are parodying.  Would you create a parody account in order to ridicule someone - or perhaps a political view you don't agree with?  What should our response be to such messages on social media?  How can we promote inclusive digital communities which embody a sense of belonging, connection, and Christian hospitality?

### Internet Trolling 


> “	Sometimes trolls live under bridges. But not everyone living under a bridge is a troll.	”

> —Wikipedia essay: [What is a troll?](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/What_is_a_troll%3F){target="_blank"}

It is estimated that that the Internet has about 5.473 billion users , almost half the population of the world (Tsvetkova, R. ^[Reference: Tsvetkova, R. [99 Amazing Social Media Statistics and Facts](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/amazing-social-media-statistics-and-facts/){target="_blank"} Brandwatch]). With the growing number of internet and social media users, we are witnessing an increase in antisocial behaviour online.

In this section, we explore the phenomenon of internet trolling and strategies for managing this disruptive online behaviour taking the communication context into account.

> ::: {.definition name="Internet troll" #troll}
An [Internet troll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(slang)){target="_blank"} is a person who sows discord on the Internet by starting arguments or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the intent of provoking readers into an emotional response, or of otherwise disrupting normal, on-topic discussion, primarily for the troll’s own amusement.

### Online Harassment 


> “Nearly three quarters of internet users—73%—have witnessed online harassment.	”
—Maeve Duggan ^[Reference: Duggan, M. (2014, October 22). [Online Harassment](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/10/22/online-harassment/)){target="_blank"} Pew Research Center]   


Many associate online harassment with more extreme cases, for example: cyberbullying and teenage suicide, or cyberstalking leading to physical sexual harassment. Notwithstanding the seriousness of these offences, antisocial behaviours associated with other forms of online harassment are more pervasive than most people realise.

In this section, we will review research on the state of online harassment and consider how leading social media sites attempt to manage the challenge.

### Activity: The State of Online Harassment {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Read the following research reports on online harassment. 

- Duggan, M. (2014, October 22). [Online Harassment](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/10/22/online-harassment/){target="_blank"}. Pew Research Center. (Note that the report comprises eight pages, so you need to click through to the next page indicators at the bottom of each page of the report.)

- Desilver, D. (2021, January 13). [Q&A: What we’ve learned about online harassment](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/01/13/qa-what-weve-learned-about-online-harassment/){target="_blank"}

Note in particular the finding that those "who have ever experienced more severe forms of harassment – such as physical threats, stalking, sexual harassment or sustained harassment – or multiple forms of harassing behaviors online have both risen substantially in the past three years. This is not the pattern we saw in prior surveys. There has been a markedly steeper rise in these measures since 2017, compared with the change between our 2014 and 2017 studies."

**Questions to Consider:**

- What surprised you when reading these reports?  
- Why have the forms of harassment become more severe?  
- Have you or someone you know experienced some kind of online harassment?

### Net Neutrality 

> *“The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past.”*
>
>***— Time Berners-Lee***

The World Wide Web was originally designed to provide universal access to a large universe of documents. To achieve universal access, it was paramount to design the web as an open system without a central locus of control. However, on the Internet there are an increasing number of “walled gardens” that aim to control user’s access to content and services. In this section we explore the concept of net neutrality and reflect on the risks associated with universal access to online information.

***Net neutrality*** is a critical concept in the realm of internet policy and regulation. It revolves around the principle that internet service providers (ISPs) should treat all data on the internet equally. In other words, they should not discriminate against or charge differently based on user, content, website, application, or platform. The primary goal of net neutrality is to ensure that the internet remains an open and level playing field, where all data and information can be accessed and transmitted freely.

</details>
<details>
<summary>**Arguments For Net Neutrality**</summary>  

- *Preservation of Open Internet*: Net neutrality proponents argue that it is essential to maintain the open nature of the internet, where all content is equally accessible to users. This fosters innovation, competition, and free expression.  
- *Equal Access*: Net neutrality ensures that users, regardless of their economic status, can access all online content without discrimination. It prevents ISPs from creating fast lanes for certain content, disadvantaging others.  
- *Innovation*: Without net neutrality, ISPs could prioritize certain services or websites, potentially stifling innovation by making it difficult for new, smaller players to compete on a level playing field.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Arguments Against Net Neutrality**</summary> 

- *Investment and Infrastructure*: Opponents argue that without the ability to offer paid prioritization or tiered services, ISPs may have less incentive to invest in and improve network infrastructure, potentially hindering the growth of broadband services.  
- *Regulatory Overreach*: Some argue that government intervention in net neutrality is unnecessary and that market forces should determine how ISPs manage their networks. They fear that regulation could lead to unintended consequences, such as the governent controling access to online content.   
- *Quality of Service*: In certain cases, ISPs claim that they need the flexibility to manage network traffic to provide a better quality of service for applications such as real-time video and gaming.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Key Concerns**</summary> 

Concerns surrounding net neutrality involve potential discrimination, a lack of competition, and the profound implications for free speech and innovation. The absence of robust net neutrality principles could pave the way for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to exert unwarranted control. They might throttle or obstruct access to specific websites, promote their own content, or levy extra charges for particular online services.

At the same time, there is a significant concern of government overreach in this digital domain. The debate over how much the government should regulate the internet is a hot topic, as it could hamper innovation and limit the free sharing of information. Excessive regulation could put the power to control or tamper with online content in the hands of the government or regulators, potentially jeopardizing our democratic values and our basic freedom of expression. Navigating this tricky balance between rules and protecting our personal freedoms is a key challenge in the digital era.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Canadian Context**</summary> 

In Canada, the discussion on net neutrality is intertwined with the debate over Bill C-10, also known as the Broadcasting Act. This bill, introduced in 2021, aims to update Canada's broadcasting and telecommunications regulations to account for the digital age. Critics of Bill C-10 have expressed concerns that it could infringe on net neutrality principles by giving more power to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to regulate online content, potentially leading to restrictions on free expression and innovation.

In addition to Bill C-10, another significant piece of legislation to consider in the Canadian context is Bill C-18, which is also known as the Online Streaming Act. This bill, introduced to the Canadian Parliament, is designed to regulate online streaming services, potentially affecting the content and accessibility of such platforms. Critics argue that Bill C-18 could raise concerns related to net neutrality by granting the government more authority over the content available on streaming platforms and potentially infringing on free expression and access to diverse content.

<br>

**Questions to Consider:**  
As you view the resources in the activity below, consider the following questions:  
- How does the principle of net neutrality impact the way you access and use the internet, and how might changes in net neutrality regulations affect your online experience?  
- What is the role of government and regulatory bodies, such as the CRTC in Canada, in ensuring a balance between net neutrality and the need to regulate online content and services?  
- What measures can be taken to ensure that government regulations, while addressing valid concerns, do not lead to the overreach of power and the erosion of fundamental rights, such as free speech, on the internet?  
- Can net neutrality coexist with the goal of ensuring high-quality internet service and fostering investment in digital infrastructure, or are these objectives inherently in conflict?

Consider drawing a mind map, such as the following to track your understanding of the subject.

Dr. Michael Geist is a law professor at the University of Ottawa where he holds the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law and is a member of the Centre for Law, Technology and Society. Browse through his [articles on Net Neutrality](https://www.michaelgeist.ca/tech-law-topics/net-neutrality/){target="_blank"}.

Here are some key points of interest from Dr. Geist:  

> "while the focus of net neutrality is typically on telecom companies, Bill C-10 envisions a different intermediary or third party – the Canadian government via the CRTC – choosing which content Canadians see by prioritizing or de-prioritizing content that appears in Canadians’ feeds. Internet sites and services will still be available to Canadians (assuming the sites aren’t blocked given the onerous regulations), but the government’s Internet regulatory framework will mean that Internet content will not be treated in a neutral, equal fashion. The mandated Canadian content discoverability requirements will mean that a government regulator will influence what Canadians see when they access Internet services, invoking the same concerns regarding interfering with content and user choice. The intermediary may have changed, but the principle is largely the same." (from [Why Bill C-10 Undermines the Government’s Commitment to the Principle of Net Neutrality](https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2021/05/why-bill-c-10-undermines-the-governments-commitment-to-the-principle-of-net-neutrality/){target="_blank"})

> It is hard to overstate how dangerous it would be for the CRTC to be vested with new powers to regularly intervene in online content or consider “conditions of service” for Internet sites and services. While the government insists that Bill C-11 is designed for large streaming services with limited regulations, it would appear that the CRTC may have other ideas. (from [CRTC Calls for Increased Powers To Take a More “Interventionist” Approach on Internet Content](https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2022/03/crtc-calls-for-more-powers-to-take-a-more-interventionist-approach-on-internet-content/){target="_blank"} (March 3, 2022))

> "it is difficult to separate the government’s willingness to censor social media posts with its broader Internet regulation agenda, including Bills C-11, C-18 and online harms. Seeking to remove news links, mean tweets and other content without due process and without any apparent illegality does not bode well for the development of Charter-compliant regulations. The government may see itself as a model for others, but its willingness to muscle social media companies in an effort to remove lawful content is the very worst kind of example that should not be welcome in a democracy that prioritizes freedom of expression." (from [Government Departments Pressure Social Media Sites to Censor News Links, Mean Tweets](https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2023/04/government-departments-pressure-social-media-sites-to-censor-news-links-mean-tweets/){target="_blank"} (April 13, 2023))


Another interesting perspective on the issue comes from [Digital First Canada](https://digitalfirstcanada.ca/fix-c11/){target="_blank"} a non profit organization that advocates on behalf of the Digital Entrepreneurs in Canada. Here is there explanation of Bill C-11: 

In its current form, Bill C-11 gives the CRTC authority to:

- Dictate how and where your content appears on digital platforms.   
- Affect your discoverability by artificially promoting some creators over others. Viewers may be pushed to watch content they aren't interested in, resulting in more skips and thumbs down, which would impact how your content is exported to global audiences, lowering viewership and revenue.   
- Apply complex “CanCon” rules that require you to prove your content is “Canadian” enough. This is easy for large Canadian media companies with teams who have been following these rules for decades, and makes it harder for smaller creators to benefit from any financial or promotional gain.  
- Push your content down in feeds if it doesn’t meet CanCon requirements.  
- Regulate the length and type of advertising on your channel, which could mean less money in your pocket.  


According to Digital First Canada, C-11 poses a threat to those who want to post their content online.  The state the following principles:   

- Digital First Creators do not require government intervention to succeed. They have thrived and led a digital content renaissance without government intervention.   
- Digital First Creators aspire for their content to be discovered by a global audience, and do not measure success within Canada’s borders.  
- Freedom of expression is a fundamental freedom. Government should not interfere with or limit the ability for lawful content to be freely discovered by users.   
- Canadian Content designations are incompatible with user generated content, and do not benefit the interests of Digital First Creators.  
-  Any mandatory contributions derived from user-generated content platforms must be for the benefit of Digital First Creators who make content for those platforms.

Facebook Zero is part of internet.org set up by Facebook and the basic websites than can be accessed for free without data charges are determined by the initiative."

...and then some criticism:

> "Facebook Zero became controversial in some countries due to several issues such as net neutrality. For instance, India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) bans zero-rated services on account of "discriminatory tariffs for data services on the basis of content”. A criticism also stated that Facebook is practicing digital colonialism because it is not introducing open internet but building a "little web that turns the user into a mostly passive consumer of mostly western corporate content”."

### Digital Redlining 

[Digital redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_redlining#:~:text=Digital%20redlining%20is%20the%20practice,digital%20content%2C%20and%20the%20internet.) refers to the discriminatory practice of denying or limiting access to certain services, information, or opportunities in the digital world, based on a person's location, economic status, race, or other demographic factors. It is an extension of the historical concept of redlining, which originally referred to the discriminatory practice of marking certain neighborhoods on physical maps and denying residents of those areas access to financial services, insurance, and other resources.

In the context of the digital age, digital redlining manifests in various ways:

**Limited Internet Access**: Some areas, often low-income neighborhoods or rural regions, may lack access to high-speed internet or affordable data plans. This limits people's ability to access online education, job opportunities, government services, and other online resources.

**Discriminatory Algorithms**: Algorithms used in various online services, such as lending, housing, and employment platforms, may inadvertently or intentionally discriminate against certain groups. For example, an algorithm may give preferential treatment to job applicants from specific demographics.

**Targeted Advertising and Privacy Concerns**: Certain demographics may be disproportionately exposed to predatory or harmful online advertisements, while more privileged individuals receive personalized, less invasive content. This can lead to manipulation and exploitation.

**Educational Disparities**: Inadequate access to technology and online educational resources can limit the learning opportunities for students in underserved communities.

**Healthcare Access**: Some communities may have limited access to telehealth services, which have become increasingly important, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Data Collection and Surveillance**: Vulnerable populations are often subject to more extensive data collection and surveillance, leading to privacy concerns and potential discrimination based on the data collected.

Addressing digital redlining is essential to ensure equitable access to the benefits of the digital age. Efforts to combat digital redlining include policies aimed at closing the digital divide, regulating algorithms to prevent discriminatory outcomes, promoting net neutrality, and protecting data privacy. These measures aim to create a more inclusive and fair digital environment for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, race, or location.


### Activity: Case Study - Indigenous Communities in Canada {-}  

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Digital redlining is a global concern, including Canada. While Canada is known for its social safety nets and relatively high internet penetration rates, digital disparities persist, particularly among marginalized communities. These disparities are evident in various aspects, such as internet access, online discrimination, and algorithmic biases.

Watch [Seneca Nation disconnected by Redlining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5NV9BJx1_M){target="_blank"}

<div class ="video-container">

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J5NV9BJx1_M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> 

</div>


This case study highlights the digital disparities faced by Indigenous communities in Canada. Many Indigenous communities, especially those in remote areas, lack reliable high-speed internet access, which hampers their ability to participate fully in the digital world. This limitation affects various aspects of life, including education, healthcare, economic opportunities, and cultural preservation.

Addressing these issues in Canada requires a multi-faceted approach, combining infrastructure development, anti-discrimination regulations, and community engagement. Initiatives like the [Connecting Families program](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/connecting-families/en){target="_blank"} and investments in broadband infrastructure are steps in the right direction, but more work is needed to ensure equitable access to the digital world for all Canadians. This includes recognizing the unique challenges faced by Indigenous communities and implementing policies that specifically address their needs while promoting digital inclusion and addressing digital redlining for all marginalized groups.

### Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

> ::: {.definition name="Diversity" #diversity}
a range of many people or things that are very different from each other; the practice or quality of including or involving people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds and of different genders, religions, etc. [Oxford Learner's Dictionary](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/diversity)
:::

**Diversity** includes differences in racial or ethnic classifications, age, gender, religion, philosophy, physical abilities, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, gender identity, intelligence, physical health, mental health, genetic attributes, personality, behavior, or political beliefs.

> ::: {.definition name="Inclusion" #inclusion}
the fact of including somebody/something;  the fact or policy of providing equal opportunities and resources for people who might otherwise not get them, for example people who are disabled or belong to minority groups. [Oxford Learner's Dictionary](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/inclusion)
:::

**Inclusion** is about a sense of belonging irrespective of national origin, age, race, ethnicity, belief, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or socioeconomic status. 

> ::: {.definition name="Equity" #equity}
a situation in which everyone is treated equally. [Oxford Learner's Dictionary](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/equity_1)
:::  

**Equity** is a proactive commitment to equal opportunity and practices that ensure inclusion without intentional (or unintentional) discrimination. 

Is equity the same as equality? 
> Equity differs from equality in a subtle but important way. While equality assumes that all people should be treated the same, equity takes into consideration a person’s unique circumstances, adjusting treatment accordingly so that the end result is equal" ^[Reference: McKinsey & Company (2022, August 17). ["What is diversity, equity, and inclusion?"](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-diversity-equity-and-inclusion){target="_blank"} McKinsey & Company (2022)]   


As we dive into this topic, consider one of our course learning outcomes:

> Create inclusive digital communities which embody a sense of belonging, connection, and Christian hospitality.

What does it mean to have an inclusive online community?  How do we see and react to differences between groups, behaviours and beliefs?  

Let's take a look at some cases and issues involving diversity, equity and inclusion online.


### Activity: Gender Discrimination {-}  

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this activity, we investigate examples of gender discrimination in a digital world, recognising that equity and inclusion are not restricted to gender alone.

As you explore the following resources, consider the following quote:

> “Ideologically. There’s a problem with the Internet. Largely designed by men from the developed world, it is built for men of the developed world. Men of science. Men of industry. Military men. Venture capitalists. Despite all the hype and hope about revolution and access and opportunity that these new technologies will provide us, they do not negate hierarchy, history, privilege, power. They reflect those. They channel it. They concentrate it, in new ways and in old.”

Next, consider the following quote:

### What is DEI? {-} 

> ::: {.definition name="DEI" #dei}
Diversity, equity, and inclusion (usually abbreviated DEI) refers to organizational frameworks which seek to promote "the fair treatment and full participation of all people", particularly groups "who have historically been underrepresented or subject to discrimination" on the basis of identity or disability. These three notions (diversity, equity, and inclusion) together represent "three closely linked values" which organizations seek to institutionalize through DEI frameworks. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion)
:::

Consider the graphic below.  How does it portray differences?  How are those differences addressed?

<a title="Equity vs Equality" href="https://flickr.com/photos/mpcaphotos/31655988501"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/715/31655988501_979c7b1c82.jpg" alt="Equity vs Equality" /></a><br /><small><a title="Equity vs Equality" href="https://flickr.com/photos/mpcaphotos/31655988501">Equity vs Equality</a> flickr photo by <a href="https://flickr.com/people/mpcaphotos">MN Pollution Control Agency</a> shared under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons (BY-NC) license</a></small>

DEI has been a hot topic for debate in recent years as organizations, including universities, have emphasized DEI in the way they conduct business, including hiring, promoting, etc. 

Let's take higher education as an example.  As faculty members design their courses, they consider the needs of their students and how to effectively engage them in the course topics.  They recognize the diversity of students needs and viewpoints and seek to create an inclusive learning environment for students.  Instructors might use [Universal Design for Learning](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/), which is "a framework to improve and optimize teaching and learning for all people based on scientific insights into how humans learn." Another teaching method they might employ is [Culturally Responsive Teaching](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/equality-inclusion-and-diversity/five-essential-strategies-to-embrace-culturally-responsive-teaching/) or [Culturally Responsive TeachingCulturally Relevant Pedagogy](http://www.inclusioncanada.net/culturallyrelevantpedagogy.html) as a way to use students' cultural experiences and perspectives as channels for effective teaching and learning (Gay, 2002). 

Key question: *Should instructors treat all students the same regardless of background, gender, beliefs, etc.?*

Many academics in higher education hold this value of equality. Others promote equity, which "takes into consideration a person’s unique circumstances, adjusting treatment accordingly so that the end result is equal" ^[Reference: McKinsey & Company (2022, August 17). ["What is diversity, equity, and inclusion?"](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-diversity-equity-and-inclusion){target="_blank"} McKinsey & Company (2022)] 
What does it mean that the "end result is equal?"  An equal opportunity to access and succeed in academia?  Or an equal outcome in which all students recieve the same grade?

This one example identifies one of the "sticky points" in the DEI debate. In the next activity, we'll introduce some views on the DEI topic.

### Activity: DEI & Practising Christian Hospitality {-}  

```{block2, type='reflect'}

As a final reflection on this topic, we invite you to read TWU's core values page on [Practising Christian Hospitality](https://www.twu.ca/about-us/commitments/core-values/practising-christian-hospitality){target="_blank"}.

TWU explains the core value of Practising Christian Hospitality: 

>Trinity Western University students, staff, faculty, and administrators are called to welcome, genuinely include and consistently care for all individuals. Christ taught and modelled hospitality to all, including those on the margins, as an essential element of Christian faith and practice. Hospitality is vital to our life in the Trinity Western University community and to our life in and witness to other communities. 

> Practising Christian hospitality undergirds and promotes equity, diversity and inclusion.

> - **Equity** is founded in our being created in the image of God; every human being has inherent dignity and worth (Gen 1:26-28; 5:1-2; Col 1:15).

> - **Diversity** is inherent in God’s creation; it is good (Gen 1:11-12, 21-25).

> - **Inclusion** is essential to the body of Christ; we are diverse and interdependent (1 Cor 12:12-31; Isa 56:3-8).

As you read [Practising Christian Hospitality](https://www.twu.ca/about-us/commitments/core-values/practising-christian-hospitality){target="_blank"}, consider the following questions, and how they relate to your identity and actions online:

- How do we advocate for the dignity of all human beings, and avoid any form of derogation or condescension?  
- How do we value the differences and the diversity in God’s creation? 
- How do we live peaceably and productively in society in the midst of enduring differences, even on very significant matters?
- Does being inclusive demand agreement or consensus?  
- How can we practice Christian hospitality

### Activity: Editorial Societal Issues on the Internet {-}  

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Publish an editorial (400 – 600 words) on your personal course blog on a societal issue or antisocial behaviour associated with the Internet. You editorial must:

- Contain a minimum of four hyperlinks to supporting resources or issues. (Your digital identity is connected to the Internet and it is important to demonstrate how your contribution joins a networked conversation through connections in information.)  
- Include a representative image embedded in your blog post (N.B. ensure that you have legal permissions to use the image).  
- If you are not sure about copyright, source a public domain image on Pixabay, but don’t use the sponsored images unless you have purchased rights to use the sponsored image.  
- Include at least two references properly cited using the APA style (see for example APA Style published by the University of Canterbury Library).  
- Include a paragraph highlighting practical implications, for example: learning in a digital age or your current role.  

Remember to add a category or tag for your post using the course tag: LDRS101.  

***The Process:***

1. Choose a topic of interest.  
2. Conduct a search to identify reliable and credible online resources on your selected topic. Try to find resources from your own country or region, or your own area of work.    
3. Select the two best resources;   
4. Read [How to write a notable editorial](https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Notable-Editorial){target="_blank"}   
5. Using the topic you selected, decide on the type of editorial, for example:   
- Explaining or interpreting  
- Criticising  
- Persuading  
- Praising  
6. Get your facts straight:  
- Revisit the online sources you identified previously.  
- Search for additional resources if needed.  
7. Prepare a thesis-like paragraph designed to catch the readers attention and introduce what your editorial is about.  
8. Prepare the body of your editorial providing an objective explanation of the issue supported by the relevant sources you have identified, for example:  
- State the opposing argument first  
- Present reasons refuting the opposition  
- Share your solutions.  
9. Prepare a paragraph on practical implications, for instance, learning in a digital age or your current role.  
10. Draft the conclusion.

## Digital Wisdom

To conclude our course, we will examine another perspective on ethics and technology.  This may tap into the foundational lens by which you approach many ethical issues, so take a moment to reflect on the following:

- What role does technology play in my social, academic, and spiritual life?  
- What guidance does the Bible have on our use of technology today?  
- How will my use of technology support my social, academic, and spiritual goals?  
  
### Activity: Digital Wisdom  {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Skim the following article in which the authors present a framework for digital wisdom, as well as practical practices that can help navigate the digital in our daily lives. 

- [A Framework for Digital Wisdom in Higher Education](https://christianscholars.com/a-framework-for-digital-wisdom-in-higher-education/){target="_blank"}

Here are some quotes that resonate with me.  Feel free to highlight your quotes using Hypothes.is, or in your personal Obsidian notes.  

> "Institutions of higher education have a crucial role and responsibility at this moment of technological change to form people who will flourish in our so-called digital age." (para 1)

> "Within the context of Christian higher education, the need to integrate new ICTs into our individual and institutional lives well and wisely—as we consider what technologies are doing to us and what we will do with them—is of utmost significance if we are committed to the cultivation of competence, character, and wisdom." (para 6)

> "Scripture enables us look behind and beyond our and others’ online identities to see ourselves and others as embodied and relational beings made in the image of God." (para 21)

> "Our use of technologies must be shaped by our intentions and values, and we must be aware of how platform interfaces, permissions, algorithms, and other design elements could interfere with our goals and obligations." (para 31)

<span class="blockhead">Questions to Consider</span>

Answer the following questions in your personal journal:  

- How can you, as a TWU student, flourish in this digital age?  
- How do the tools you use shape you? How do you use them wisely?

## Topic

**Digital Rights Management**

In a digital world, you may not have the full ownership rights you expect, or are accustomed to receiving in the physical world, when you buy digital content, resources, and equipment. In this section we explore digital rights management, geoblocking, and other examples. We highlight the importance users have to study the terms of reference and licenses when using proprietary software and buying products that rely on digital technology.

**Mini Challenge Summary**

**Summary:** Explore and discuss the impact of digital rights management. Time: 30–45 minutes. Consult the suggested resources and participate in the digital rights management debate.

<span class="prote">John Deere 9530 c.jpg</span>

**Digital Rights Management (DRM):** Digital rights management (DRM) describes the practice of imposing technical restrictions (hardware or software) to restrict what users can do with the digital content or operation of their equipment. 

**Examples include:**

- Film studios that embed software on their DVDs that restricts the number of copies a legal user can make to two.  
- Computer games that restrict the number of devices on which the game can be installed requiring server authentication to keep track of the number of installations.  
- e-Book publishers who restrict the ability to copy or print the materials.

**Reading**

- Layton, J. (Jan. 3, 2006). How Digital Rights Management Works. Retrieved July 4, 2017. (Click on the next button to progress the sub-pages of the article.)

**Geoblocking:** Geoblocking is a form of DRM which restricts access to content based on geographical location; for example, restrictions associated with media rights for sport coverage or films in different parts of the world because copyright holders sell broadcast and distribution rights to different companies around the world. Frequently, prices for streamed services of the same content will differ from country to country.

In another example, an individual who buys DVD films in one country and then emigrates to another country, may find that the playback of the legally purchased content is restricted by technology means in the new country of residence.

**Reading**

Geoblocking from Wikipedia;

EU lawmakers Include Spotify and iTunes in Geoblocking Ban from Reuters.

Case study - The Right to Repair

Do farmers have the right to repair their own tractors? Not necessarily, for example, John Deere’s proprietary software used to operate the vehicle does not allow “owners” to repair systems themselves and in effect they only have an implied license for life to operate the vehicle.

**Readings**

Choose one or two of the following readings (feel free to annotate using Hypothes.is and remember to tag your posts using the course code: lida102):

- We Can’t Let John Deere Destroy the Very Idea of Ownership from Wired.
- Why American Farmers are Hacking their own Tractors from the Guardian  
- A Right to Repair: Why Nebraska Farmers are Taking on John Deere and Apple from the Guardian.  
- The Fight for the “Right to Repair” from Smithsonian.com.  
- Outputs  

**Digital Rights Management Debate**

- Seeing both sides of a debate gives you the opportunity to better understand the issues. In this discussion, choose one of  

**the questions listed below and post to the DRM debate. Your post should include:**

- A sentence summarizing the issue.  
- The most important reason, in your opinion, why DRM is appropriate in a digital world.   
- The most important reason, in your opinion, why DRM is not appropriate in a digital world.  

<span class="blockhead">Questions to Consider (optional)</span>

- Do you have personal experience of a DRM issue? Summarize the example and present both sides of the issue.  
- Do you have personal experience of a geoblocking issue? Summarize the example and present both sides of the issue.  
- Should owners of equipment have the right to repair? Summarize the example and present both sides of the issue.
