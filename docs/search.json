    "text": "Overview\nWelcome to Unit 1 of Learning with Technology! This course will introduce you to some ideas related to living, learning, and working in our digitally saturated society. It is our intent to equip you with an emerging set of skills and literacies related to digital tools for learning. Within your academic pursuits, you will encounter a vast amount of information—integrating digital tools into your learning journey, though challenging, is essential for harnessing the ample learning possibilities offered by your chosen discipline. This course will give you a head start on using digital tools to build a workflow, enabling you to stay organized and to make your learning process visible to both you and your instructors. We will also lead you through readings and discussions on topics such as digital identity, privacy, security, and ethical ways of sharing newfound knowledge.\nThere will be two primary branches of the course, each focusing on specific tools that we will introduce to you. The first branch will be a workflow that is private to you because it takes place primarily on your own computer, and the second branch is shared as publicly as you are comfortable sharing. You will have control over how public your work is, but we will think about the importance of sharing knowledge and how to do that easily and in ways that preserve your “ownership” over your work.\nIn this first unit, there will be both theoretical and practical work for you to do. We start with some basic instructions and advice on technology and learning online. Then, in order to build a theoretical understanding of digital tools for learning we will explore the idea of “the digital” in the context of contemporary society. At the same time, there are some important practicalities to manage in order to get set up for the course, so we will lead you through installing some apps on your computer that you will use extensively in this course, and which hopefully will become the backbone of your digital workflow throughout your time in higher education and beyond.",

    "section": "1.1 Learning Online",
    "text": "1.1 Learning Online\nIn face-to-face teaching environments the requirement to physically attend class, coupled with community accountability, makes a learner’s individual learning skills less relevant for academic success. However, when learning online there is less instructor oversight, motivation, and accountability, requiring the student to have the skills required to learn effectively. While a face-to-face instructor might notice that their student is absent, confused, or falling behind, and will check in on their well-being and offer support for their success, an online instructor often has less opportunity to do this. The learner is therefore required to have strong learning skills, recognize their responsibility as a self-directed learner, and practice these skills accordingly.\nOnline learning requires additional skills differing from face-to-face learning, and since online learning is often self-paced, an absence of these skills will make a student’s learning experience difficult. According to Crozier and Lake (2020) these skills include:\n\nTime management (i.e., effectively managing deadlines, schedules)\nOrganization (i.e., creating a dedicated study space, ability to easily access material)\nSelf-motivation (i.e., scheduling set times for coursework, peer study accountability)\nSelf-regulation (i.e., strategies can include breaks, physical activity, meditation)\nStrong written and oral communication (i.e. technical writing skills, ability to communicate with others and ask for assistance if needed.)\n\nHere are a couple more ways you can hone your online learning skills:\n\nActive participation: Actively engage in online discussions, forums, and virtual class sessions to enhance your understanding and connect with peers.\nRegular communication with instructors: Establish clear lines of communication with instructors, seeking clarification when needed and participating in office hours or virtual meetings.\nUtilize online resources: Take advantage of digital resources provided by the university, including online libraries, research databases, and academic support services.\nTech preparedness: Ensure your computer and internet connection are reliable, and familiarize yourself with the required software tools for the course.\nActive reading and note taking: Develop effective reading strategies and take concise notes to enhance comprehension and retain key information.\nCollaborate with peers: Foster virtual collaboration with classmates through group projects, study groups, and peer discussions to enrich your learning experience.\nRegular self-assessment: Reflect on your progress regularly, assess your understanding of the material, and adjust your study strategies accordingly.\n\nRemember, flexibility and adaptability are key in the online learning environment. Tailor these tips to your individual needs and the specific requirements of your courses. Note also that you will have opportunities to practice these skills throughout the course.\nHere is some additional advice from TWU students.\n\nWatch Learning Online: Student Tips for Success (2020)\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Activity: Learning Online Effectively\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are thousands of websites that offer advice such as “tips for online learning” or “how to succeed in your online class,” and some of those sites are good (see here, here, and here ). Some of them are also connected to shady people who want less than your best interests. One of the shining examples of a great resource is the Liberated Learner project, which was created primarily by university and college students like you. There are four main sections in the Liberated Learner resource—we will explore “The Learner” in this activity.\n\nTake some time to work through The Learner (2022). It begins with a short video and includes activities that you can complete. These are for your reflection.\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nHaving worked through The Learner, consider the ideas you think would be most beneficial for your online studies. To record your thoughts, you could create a list of your top ten study tips for online learning, or maybe write a message to a friend or sibling who is considering attending TWU next year.\nFollowing this, reflect on how you can work to ensure your own success in your online courses. What are your goals, and what specific steps will you take to achieve them?\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Activity: Online Discussions\nParticipating in discussions with your peers (what higher education folks like to call discourse—a verb), is an essential aspect of effective online courses, facilitated through platforms such as Moodle discussion forums, WordPress blogs, Discourse posts (in this case, a noun—referring to the app called Discourse), and others. We all know that discussion forums can sometimes be tedious, especially when they are assessed in the same way a formal paper is assessed. However, the benefits of using asynchronous technologies (where your interactions with others are time-delayed) in well-designed activities can be significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is an article that will introduce you to some key ideas about discussion forums:\n\nStudents’ Engagement in Asynchronous Online Discussion: The Relationship Between Cognitive Presence, Learner Prominence, and Academic Performance (2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may need to sign in to the TWU library to access this article. You can find help here.\n\n\n\nWhile you read, make notes and then create a summary.\n\nFirst of all, don’t get too bogged down in the “Method” section of this article, but carefully read sections 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and the Appendix.\nWhile you read, jot down some notes, either in a notebook on paper, or in a file on your computer.\nOnce you are done, write a two to three sentence summary in your own words of the article and how it relates to you and your experience.Do not hesitate to look up words that you don’t understand, and include the definitions in your notes.\nInclude at least one question that you have about the article in your notes.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion Guidelines for LDRS 101\nIn this course, we will ask you to discuss ideas with your peers via Discourse, WordPress, and other social media platforms. These discussions are ungraded, meaning, your instructor will not give you marks per discussion. However, they are an important part of this course and you will not be able to complete your assignments without discussing with your peers. Consider for example, two course learning outcomes that relate to online discussions:\n\nDevelop personal and professional learning networks to discover and share knowledge, collaborate with others, and become engaged digital global citizens\nCreate inclusive digital communities which embody a sense of belonging, connection, and Christian hospitality\n\nYour discussion posts may be used as learning artifacts to demonstrate your understanding of the course learning outcomes (see Assignment details in Moodle).\nIn LDRS 101, you should write your posts in a way that shows you are communicating in an academic setting. While you don’t need to adhere to all of the conventions of APA formatting, you should practice the principles of proper citation. For example, to cite an idea from the article in the previous activity, it would look like the following (Galikyan & Admiraal, 2019), and the bottom of the post would include a “References” heading, followed by the full reference (this part may be considered optional since we have included a link to the article in the in-text citation, but it is nice to have). Please consult the APA Style website for details.\nIt is highly recommended1 that you begin using a reference manager—we recommend Zotero as it is a free and open source app with all you will ever need to cite properly in any style. We will lead you through some specifics of using Zotero in the next unit of LDRS 101, but you can download Zotero for free.\nIn short, similar to a live classroom discussion you need to be polite and professional, and you need to provide evidence for your views, but, as in a normal conversation, you won’t have all of the formalities of academic writing. In LDRS 101, you should consider your forum posts as a time to practice and test your ideas. The stakes are very low, so it is fine to make mistakes.\nIn online discussion forums, learners are encouraged to respond substantively. What does this mean?\nSubstantive responses may include:\n\nProviding a new thought, idea, or perspective\nCiting an experience or example of what we are learning\nAdding a new twist on a perspective\nCritically thinking about an idea or concept\nQuestioning or challenging a principle or perspective\nAsking a question or making a comment that shows you are interested in what another person says or encourages another person to elaborate on something they have already said\nSharing a resource (a reading, web link, video) not covered in the syllabus that adds new information or perspectives to our learning\nMaking a comment that underscores the link between two people’s contributions and making this link explicit in your comment, or making a summary observation that takes into account several people’s contributions and that touches on a recurring theme in the discussion\n\nWhat substantive participation is NOT:\n\nVery basic comments such as “I agree” or “I disagree”\nRestating what has been said (unless there is a direct purpose in doing so)\nDisrespectfully disagreeing\nPat answers that are not thought-provoking or do not move the dialogue forward\n\nHere are some examples of how to stimulate your own and others’ thinking:\n\nWhat would happen if …\nOther times it may be helpful to …\nIt is my understanding … what is your experience with this?\nYou might approach this from …\nIs it possible that …\nWould you consider …\nMaybe …\nPossibly …\nSometimes …\nI’m wondering if …\nDo you think …\n\n\nFor more on substantive participation, read Writing a Substantive Discussion Post for an Online Class Forum (2016).\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Activity: Start a Conversation!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHead over to the Learning Hub on Discourse and find the Leadership 101 category. Start a conversation about one of the following (or something else relevant):\n\nSomething that has interested you about learning online\nYour goals for your academic studies\nHow will you stay motivated in this course?\nWhat digital literacy skills do you hope to gain, and how will those benefit you in your academic and professional career?\nA “Wow” and a “Wonder” about online learning",

    "section": "1.2 Understanding the Digital",
    "text": "1.2 Understanding the Digital\nOur next topic is an introduction to the idea of “the digital.” You may recognize that digital tools are deeply embedded in modern society. It is not uncommon for people of all ages to interact with apps and tools that claim to connect people in conversations or networks, or to perform complex tasks for work, or to control various systems in our vehicles. Digital technology is really everywhere we look. Thinking about these tools is one way to conceptualize how we interact with digital tools but we can also recognize that our social practices and norms have been impacted by digital tools. An example of this, at least in North America, is that the names of companies have become verbs. If people want to learn something about a topic, they Google it. Mobile phones are often essential tools for communication, social media, internet browsing, messaging, entertainment, photography, navigation, online shopping, mobile banking, productivity, two-factor authentication for some websites, and health and fitness management. In some cases, such as in social media, it is almost impossible to participate in public discourse without access to technology.\nModern universities are also deeply impacted by the digital. Every system involved in higher education has been digitized in some manner, including recruitment, accounting, and fundraising. As you begin your university career, here are some digital systems you will likely encounter:\n\nCourses are designed and often delivered digitally.\nCourse logistics (discussion forums, assignment submissions, quizzes, gradebooks) happen in large digital tools called learning management systems (LMS) or virtual learning environments (VLE) such as Moodle.\nAssignments must often be created digitally (using word processors, presentation software, video editors, website builders).\nResearch data is gathered, stored, analyzed, and shared digitally.\n\nThere are many other processes and procedures that rely on the digital in higher education, but the important thing for you to realize is that there are many tools that you will be required to learn and use. Some are obvious, such as word processors, presentation software, email, the library website, and the LMS, but others are less obvious and won’t necessarily be taught specifically, other than in this course.\nSome of the digital tools we will introduce to you will help you build a workflow for you to manage the huge amount of information and resources that you will have to sort through to complete many of your assignments. You will learn to use AI to find relevant resources on whatever your topic might be. As you know from searching Google, a simple search of the web can turn up thousands or millions of hits, but there are tools that can help you highlight the most relevant resources in just a few clicks. Once you find resources, we will show you tools that will allow you to track all your references, create citations in your writing quickly and easily, and then create a perfectly formatted reference list. Do not waste your time creating your own bibliographies! This one tool will save you days and likely weeks of work during your degree (quite literally). We will show you another tool that will allow you to make connections between ideas and notes so that you build a network of connected ideas. Curating this network of ideas is possibly one of the most useful things you can do. You will end up with a searchable network of everything you’ve learned and be able to visualize it at the click of a button. We will help you think through the implications of how you present yourself on the web so that you can make wise decisions about what you share and how you share it. We will also help you make connections on the web that could become a key resource for your learning and working in your career.",

    "section": "1.3 Digital Literacies",
    "text": "1.3 Digital Literacies\n\nDigital literacy is a person’s knowledge, skills, and abilities for using digital tools ethically, effectively, and within a variety of contexts in order to access, interpret, and evaluate information, as well as to create, construct new knowledge, and communicate with others. (Government of British Columbia, n.d., p. 23)\n\nLiteracy, as we commonly understand it, is the ability to understand the meaning of texts. It is more than just being able to read. In the same way, digital literacy is the ability to make meaning using digital tools. It is more than simply being able to post to Instagram or TikTok, or whatever app you might use. As the definition above indicates, digital literacy involves using tools ethically, to access, interpret, evaluate, create, construct, and communicate information and knowledge.\n\n“In today’s world, being literate requires much, much more than the traditional literacy of yesterday.” (Alber, 2013)\n\nWhat digital tools do you use to help you make meaning? What is your “go-to” app for note taking, organizing files, tracking references, and connecting ideas? One valuable tool we are going to show you is called Obsidian, a free note taking and mind mapping app. Before you go through the instructions in the activity below, watch the video This is Obsidian. (2021).\nWatch: This is Obsidian \n\n\n1.3.1 Activity: Getting Started With Obsidian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the steps below to install Obsidian on your computer.\n\nGo to obsidian.md and follow these instructions to install Obsidian on your computer.\n\nIt is recommended that you use a computer rather than a mobile phone to install Obsidian, but please let your instructor or facilitator know if you are on mobile.\nYou do NOT need to purchase any upgrades such as Obsidian Sync or Obsidian Publish.\n\nWork through the Getting Started section of the Obsidian help pages starting with Create a vault.\n\nWhen you create the vault in this step, we recommend that you name it TWU or something similar. Later, you can create as many vaults as you would like.\n\nIt is recommended that you use one of the sync services listed here so that your files are backed up.\n\nIf you are having any difficulty in installing Obsidian, feel free to reach out for support on the Learning Hub. There are also several tutorials and videos online; you are encouraged to seek out these resources. One example is Obsidian for Beginners: Start HERE — How to Use the Obsidian App for Notes (2020). The first minute shows how to set up Obsidian … and if you’d like a sneak peek at the amazing features this tool has to offer, watch on! We’ll get to these additional uses of Obsidian later in the course.\n\n\nObsidian will become a backbone of this course as we will use it to learn how the web works and give you a workflow that will help you stay organized. One of the advantages of Obsidian is that everything you do in the app happens on your own computer, rather than the cloud, which is just another way of saying someone else’s computer. However, the drawback to that is that you need to ensure that you have a backup of your vaults in a secure location, either one of the sync services mentioned in Step 3, above, or another backup system. Please check the Learning Hub or talk to your instructor or facilitator for help with this.\n\n\n1.3.2 Activity: Download the Starter Vault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo give you a head start, we have created a starter vault for you to download and use. Follow the instructions below to access the starter vault.\n\nClick this link to download the vault\nThis will download a file called ldrs101-vault-main.zip to your computer\nThe .zip extension means that this is a compressed file and it contains multiple other files inside\nMove the compressed file to your Documents folder\nUnzip or extract the contents of the file; you should see a list of files similar to the image below\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Screenshot of Extracted Files List on Obsidian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename the folder to ldrs101-[firstname-lastname] (use all lowercase letters and a dash instead of spaces)\nOpen Obsidian and click the “Open another vault” icon in the bottom left corner\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Screenshot of the Open Another Vault Button in Obsidian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the ldrs101-[firstame-lastname] folder, and then Obsidian will ask you to trust this vault\nClick “Trust author and enable plugins”\nOnce you are in the vault, feel free to take a look around—you will notice a Home page, a Tools folder with some files in it, and a VR Diagram Canvas\n\n\n\nNow that you have a place to record your course notes, let’s jump back into the discussion about digital literacy. Traditionally, literacy was about speaking, listening, reading and writing. Literacy has taken on a much broader and complex meaning. Today there’s also digital literacy, media literacy, new literacy, and so on. In the activity below you are invited to reflect on how your literacies have changed when compared to your parents, and to speculate on new literacies the next generation of learners may need for the future.\n\n\n1.3.3 Activity: Reflection on the 21st Century Learner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following video by the MacArthur Foundation questions how digital media are changing the way young people learn, play, socialize, and participate in civic life. In it, John Seely Brown, a researcher with particular interests in radical innovation and digital culture, suggests that today’s gaming oriented children want to be measured and feel that if they are not learning, it is not fun. How does this relate to how you feel about learning?\nWatch: Rethinking Learning: The 21st Century Learner (2010)\n\nWhile you watch the video think about:\n\nWhat “literacy” skills have you acquired when compared to your parents?\nWhat “literacy” skills will be important for future learners in higher education?\n\nReflect on the following writing prompts:\n\nMy parents did not need to …\nA new literacy I acquired is the ability to …\nHigher education students of the future will need to …\n… is an important 21st century skill for future employment\n\nTo complete this activity, click “Open Today’s Daily Note” in your Obsidian vault and write your reflections.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Screenshot, Obsidian, Where to Find Today’s Daily Note (Icon Circled)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStyle your text using Markdown codes. Click here for the basic Markdown syntax (n.d.).\nFeel free to add images and other media!\n\nPlease make sure you add tags to your note. Suggested tags might be #digital-literacy #ldrs101 #macarthur-foundation #john-seely-brown.\nNotice that tags start with a hashtag and contain no spaces. Separate words with a hyphen.\n\n\nLet’s dive a little deeper into this topic of digital literacy. What is it? How would you define digital literacy?\nIn the next activity, you will start to unpack this term and prepare your own initial definition of digital literacy.\n\n\n1.3.4 Activity: Defining Digital Literacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the definitions of digital literacy and digital skills on the web and identify the difference. Follow the steps below and feel free to jot down some notes in your Obsidian journal. If you are completing this activity on a new day, create a new daily note.\n\nRead Wikipedia’s definition (2024) of digital literacy—is this a good description?\nScan the #diglit or #digital-literacy hashtags on X (Twitter) — did you find any valuable links to defining digital literacy?\nConduct a Google search for “digital literacy.” Select a few definitions you like and record their URLs, for example by adding these to your browser bookmarks.\nConduct a Google search for “digital skills.” Select one or two definitions you like and record the URLs.\nConduct a Google search for “digital fluency.” Select one or two definitions.\nWhat are the differences between digital literacies, digital fluency, and digital skills? How are these concepts related?\nRead What is Digital Literacy? (2014) by POMO—is this a reliable source?\nHow would you rate the academic quality of the definitions you found (e.g., low or high quality)?\nWhat did you discover?\n\nShare your thoughts and experiences by posting on the LDRS 101 Discourse chat. For example:\n\nThe major difference between digital skills and literacies is …\nI didn’t realize that …\nFor me, digital literacy means …”\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5 Digital Literacies and Skills\nDigital literacies for academic learning involves more than Facebook, Snapchat, or X (Twitter) and the associated technical skills in using these technologies.\nAs you explore the concept, you will find online resources which confuse digital skills with digital literacies. The activities which follow aim to provide an initial introduction to the wide range of digital literacies associated with academic learning. We will explore the concept of digital literacies in greater depth as we progress with the course. When exploring these online resources we encourage you to differentiate between skills and literacies, and to develop a critical disposition. Digital literacies involve issues, norms, and habits of mind surrounding technologies used for a particular purpose. However, these literacies are closely related to technical proficiency in using a range of digital applications.\n\n\n1.3.6 Activity: What Are Digital Literacies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch educator and researcher Doug Belshaw as he discusses his digital literacies framework:\n\nWatch: The Essential Elements Of Digital Literacies: Doug Belshaw At TedxWarwick (2012)\n\n\n\nNext, read the Quick Guide - Developing Students’ Digital Literacy (n.d.)\n\nThis guide defines digital literacies as “the capabilities which fit an individual for living, learning and working in a digital society (n.d., Introduction).” Furthermore, this report distinguishes between seven elements of digital literacies:\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Career Ready Framework\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote. From “Quick Guide - Developing Students’ Digital Literacy,” by Jisc Digital Experience Insights, n.d., p. 2, . CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 UK.\n\n\n\nDo you agree that these are the key literacies you need to live, learn, and work in today’s society? What would you add?\nConduct a quick Google search for “digital literacies” and add in terms such as “essential,” “top,” “21st century.” What other literacies or skills are emphasized? What would your list be for digital literacies that are important for you?\n\n\n\n\n1.3.7 Activity: Why Digital Literacy Matters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA key component of digital literacy and networked learning relates to the ability to engage meaningfully in online learning communities.\nThis learning activity will provide you with another opportunity to connect with your peers in Discourse and contribute to online learning discussions.\nWatch the following video and jot down the reasons why digital literacy matters to you, then complete the steps which follow.\n\nWatch: Digital Literacy and Why it Matters (2014)\n\n\n\nGo to the LDRS 101 section in Discourse\nPost a contribution to the discussion on digital literacies and why they are important for you\nPost one or two replies to interesting contributions (you should also “like” good contributions, use the person’s username when replying, and if appropriate, quote a reply when responding.)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.8 Activity: Am I Digitally Literate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital literacy encompasses a wide range of capabilities which extend beyond the digital skills associated with different technologies. Consider the digital literacies you identified from the previous activity.\n\nJot down one or more technologies or tools you would recommend for each of the skills and assess your competence in using each particular technology or tool (e.g., below average, average, above average, or excellent).\nNext, use your searching skills to discover online tests for assessing your digital literacies (don’t spend more than 15 to 20 minutes on the self-assessment activity).\n\nConduct a Google search using “digital literacy self-assessment”\nChoose a link to conduct a self-assessment of your digital literacy\n\n\nAlternatively, you can choose from these resources:\n\nTake the Digital Literacy Self-Assessment (n.d.) from the Canadian Association for Supported Employment or\nUse the Digital Literacy Self-Assessment Tool (2020) from the Digital Citizenship Guide or\nExplore the What is Digital Literacy? page of the Digital Literacies Toolkit (n.d.) developed by the University of Southampton.\n\nQuestions to Consider:\n\nDid the self-assessment you chose focus on digital skills or digital literacies?\nWhat did you learn from this exercise?\n\nShare your thoughts by posting on Discourse.\n\n\n\n\n1.3.9 Visitors and Residents\nOne way to start thinking about digital literacy is to create a map of the apps and tools that you use, how you use them, and what traces of your presence you leave behind on the web. We call this a Visitors and Residents Diagram. To complete this activity, we’ll first discuss some key concepts.\nHave you encountered the terms “digital natives” and “digital immigrants?” What are your initial thoughts on their definitions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Marc Prensky coined the terms “digital natives” and “digital immigrants.” We recognize that the term “native” should not be used to talk about people.\n\n\n\nThe essential argument is that certain generations have changed, in that they have an innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those generations whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to kids. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky’s original article.\nDigital native\n\nAside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that young people are comfortable using social media apps such as TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but this doesn’t imply a superior aptitude for learning technology compared to older generations, or an inherent proficiency in doing so. For example, are most first-year university students proficient in using a spreadsheet to create a budget? If they have created a budget, it’s more likely they use an app than a spreadsheet.\nWe’d like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a visitor in some web spaces and a resident in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you quite literally visit, but importantly, don’t leave a public trace of your time there. You don’t spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving.\nAlternately, there are places and spaces on the web where you reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook or Instagram, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or X (formerly Twitter), or maybe it’s a blog, or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people, where you are socially present.\nAt the same time, if we can imagine the visitor \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal \\(\\updownarrow\\) professional (or educational) continuum on a vertical axis, leading to four quadrants where you might situate your technology use.\n\n\n1.3.10 Activity: Where Am I Online?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video below explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web.\n\nWatch: Visitors and Residents (2014)\n\n\nQuestions to Consider:\n\nWhat surprised you as you watched the video?\nHow can you apply the concepts presented to your experience in learning with technology?\n\nFeel free to jot down your notes in Obsidian.\n\n\nNow to the task of creating your own Visitors and Residents Diagram.\nSee the diagram below … keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that its creator has been using for a decade or more, and that they have invested their career in educational technology. There is a lot here; yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. Or perhaps your diagram has a plethora of tools you use regularly. The key idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about which tools you may have tried or are interested in pursuing. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us the opportunity to reside there.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Visitor–Resident Diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is certainly notable that this diagram’s creator is very much a visitor in Moodle! This does not mean that they don’t spend much time there, they spend a significant portion of every day working in Moodle, rather, the work that they do there leaves very little trace of their personality. You will (hopefully) see Moodle as much more of a place where you reside. But this foregrounds the question of whether Moodle is actually designed to promote residencies. Certainly the forums allow for users to project their persona into the system, as do a few of the other features, but the system itself is very heavily templated. There are profiles that can be edited, but users are limited to one very tiny image, and virtually no opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to share. There is little room for customization, and every time a course ends every single user must recreate their persona in a new course site (or five).\nFor many university students, a Learning Management System (LMS) like Moodle is a perfectly reasonable place to reside and they feel comfortable accessing course materials, finding their grades, communicating with classmates, and so on. And just like our physical homes, the quality of the community that lives there isn’t determined by the features of the house itself, but by the people who share the space and how they structure their time and interactions.\n\n\n1.3.11 Activity: Visitor and Resident Diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis activity will help you think about how the tools we use shape and sometimes determine the nature of our interactions with each other. Do the tools you use fall on the visitor or the resident end of your continuum? How do these tools impact your learning?\n\nRead Visitors and Residents: A New Typology for Online Engagement (2011)\nCreate a new canvas in your Obsidian vault and create your own Visitor–Resident Diagram. We have created a sample diagram in the vault.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis diagram can be used to demonstrate your understanding of the course learning outcomes.

    "section": "1.4 Digital Privacy and Safety",
    "text": "1.4 Digital Privacy and Safety\nNow that you have assessed some of your digital skills or literacies, let’s focus our attention on privacy and safety. In this section we summarize important practices as a reminder to remain vigilant in protecting your privacy and security online. If you are unsure about good security practices, there are a wealth of online resources you can (and should) consult.\n\nPrivacy\nYour privacy is fragile, easy to lose instantaneously, and difficult to retrieve in an environment that requires so much online interaction.\n\nIdentity theft happens, frequently.\n\nNever put your social insurance number, your birthday, your mother’s maiden name, or any other personal facts anywhere online. Everyone on the internet will be able to access this information.\nAlways assume that anything you write online (including email) can, and probably will, eventually leak. Keep your email address private—to avoid receiving spam. If your email is published in a plain form anywhere online, even if it is part of an archived email list, spammers will “harvest” it for their databases.\n\nSpam email (at least half of all email being sent) is an unfortunate fact of our modern lives.\n\nIf you must publish your email address online, consider creating a “sacrificial” email address, or one you only use to publish online. You can create an email “alias” which you can set to automatically forward to your primary email, and easily disable if your spam volumes increases. Many email services will automatically generate random email addresses that you can use to hide your true address.\nAnother approach is to avoid publishing the email address as something like mailto:myname@somewebdomain.net. Instead, you might use more confusing text, such as myname-at-somewebdomain-net. Some websites support using these types of obfuscation methods, but the spammers who “scrape” email addresses from websites to populate their spam databases use increasingly sophisticated methods to defeat these methods.\nBasically, avoid publishing the email addresses you value online to decrease the amount of spam you receive.\n\n\n\n\nPasswords\nWhat about passwords? Many people have just one, or maybe a few. Given the number of websites and web services which require password-based authentication, this is not good enough to avoid an identity disaster.\nThe problem with having only a few passwords is that even resource-rich and security-critical organizations have suffered massive leaks. If even one of them suffers a data leak, identity thieves will obtain your password and try to use it on other websites. It is easy for them to do this using computer technologies.\nOther ways someone can get your password include:\n\nSniffing traffic when you log in to a nonsecure website that uses http:// rather than https:// (the “s” stands for secure because your data transmission’s encrypted). Look for the Lock icon.png in your address bar.\nSniffing emails—your email, unless encrypted, is not secure. Never send a login and password along with the web address of a service (similarly, don’t send credit card numbers).\nPhishing attacks—where someone sends you an email that looks like it is from a trusted sender, such as from a friend, your bank, an online store you frequent, or a government agency, and asks you to enter your password to confirm it. No one should ever ask you to enter your password via email.\nAlways check the web address (hover over the link) to make sure it corresponds to the right place or call the sender to confirm the request over the phone.\nBrute force—hackers often use computers to guess your password, beginning with a list of common passwords, and try different combinations until they get it right, or until the system locks them out for trying too many times.\n“How secure is my password” sites—you should avoid these sites and never type your password into a website or email response that is not appropriate, especially when you know the sender also knows your email.\nOnce your email and any password combination are known, identity thieves will try to use them at various websites, because they know most people only use a few passwords. A thief who discovers a password you created for a website you rarely use will try to compromise the security of a website that is important to you such as your email system, your workplace, social media accounts, or bank account.\n\nHere is a table that shows how quickly passwords can be cracked using brute force methods. Note that the best passwords are both long and include a mix of numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, and symbols.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Time Needed to Crack Passwords of Varying Complexity in a Brute Force Attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote From “Are Your Passwords in the Green in 2023?,” by C. Nesky, 2023, Hive Systems (https://www.hivesystems.com/blog/are-your-passwords-in-the-green-2023). Copyright 2024 Hive Systems. Reprinted with permission.\n\n\n\nThere are services you can use to check if your email is part of a leaked password data set. So, what can you do to protect yourself?\n\n\nPassword Managers\nGet a password manager. They are incredibly helpful and convenient now that many of us use several computers and mobile devices. Password managers help you manage your passwords.\n\nWhen you choose a password manager make sure you create one strong password, such as a full sentence with some numbers and special characters. This is all you need to remember—the password manager remembers the others. The ensures you generate a different, fully random password for each website you use that requires a password.\nGood password managers only ever store your details in an encrypted form, where even the company that stores it cannot see your passwords. To access your passwords, you log into the password manager service using your single, strong password (via a secure web link—usually the default, but always check!).\nThere are many password manager options. Some widely used proprietary options include Lastpass and 1password. Open source options also exist, such as Bitwarden. Sadly, some of the most popular password managers have suffered from software bugs that have exposed user passwords.\n\n\n\n1.4.1 Activity: Get a Password Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t already use a password manager, set up an account with Lastpass, 1password, or the free password manager, Bitwarden to familiarize yourself with how password managers work.\n\nRead How to Start Using a Password Manager (2021).\nCreate an account on the password manager site and establish a master password (conduct an online search for advice on choosing a secure master password).\nInstall the browser extension for your local browser.\nChoose one of the TWU course websites and set up a new secure password using your password manager.\nLog out of the TWU course website and log in again using the password manager.\nInstall the mobile phone app for your operating system, and desktop application for your computer (if this applies). Synchronize the local app with your online vault.\nConsider using the password manager for your online accounts so you can easily set up and maintain a unique password for each online account you use.\n\n\n\n\nGood Messaging Hygiene\nAlways assume that anyone can and will read anything you write in an email. Email is not a secure form of communication. Few people encrypt their email because it is an extra step that even the most technically inclined users are reluctant to take. Both sender and recipient have to be technically proficient.\nText messages and instant messaging programs such as Facebook Messenger are also insecure. Anyone, including government officials and the organization that runs the service, such as Facebook employees, can read it.\n\n\nSecure Your Own Privacy\nNever send any sensitive data such as your social insurance number, credit card number, password, or other personal information via email or text. Call the person to provide this information over the phone.\nYou can use a secure, encrypted text message service such as Signal if necessary. It is available at no cost, works on most platforms, and encrypts text messages on your phone. If you text someone else with Signal installed, the entire transaction is encrypted.\n\n\nSecure the Privacy of Others\nAnother element of good digital hygiene is to protect the identity of others. For example, never send group emails using To: or CC: (carbon copy) for each email address. You will reveal the email addresses for everyone on your list. This is especially problematic if you or another person saves the email message and displays it on the web, such as in a mailing list archive. This makes it easy for spammers and hackers to access and download all of those email addresses.\nUse BCC: (blind carbon copy), to hide the email addresses from your recipients to protect everyone’s privacy. Use your own email address, and BCC the rest of the recipients, if your email software requires you to insert an email address into the To: box.\nWhen using an email mailing list where you send messages to a single email address to a list of people, never CC: someone else in the same message. This will compromise the privacy of every CC’d recipient and the privacy of the list. Always check with the people on the list to ensure you are not taking unacceptable liberties.\nIf someone asks you to share an email address of a friend or colleague you should ask permission to share their email address, and state why the third party is requesting their email.\n\n\nBe a Thoughtful Sceptic\nSo how can we protect ourselves if new threats are emerging all the time?\n\nBe conscious of where you put information that is “private” to you.\nBeware of the terms of service (ToS) of social media providers such as Facebook. Use a service such as Terms of Service: Didn’t Read (TOSDR) to help identify risky, overreaching services. You may be able to use certain privacy settings to protect your information.\nAlways check the identity of a website before you enter any passwords or personal information. Secure certificates are generally trustworthy but be sure to check the names and details.\nAlways ask whether you should trust a provider or a government agency. Always ask “who benefits when I do this?” What are their incentives?\nProtect your own data and be even more protective of others’ private information. For example, be cautious before posting information about yourself or someone else. Be especially cautious when posting pictures or videos of their children.\nRemember, complacency and unwarranted trust are your biggest enemies. A healthy paranoia is good for your digital health. Think about the great amount of time and effort it will take to regain your identity (and credit rating) if your information is compromised.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Activity: Tos Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the Terms of Service: Didn’t Read (n.d.) site to look up each of the apps we will learn in this course. Each tool currently has its own file in your Obsidian vault with a template ready to go for you. Fill out the template for each tool based on what is available on tosdr.org and your own examination of the ToS for each tool.\nFeel free to add components to the template. Note we’re return to this website at the end of Unit 4 as we evaluate digital tools.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Activity: Introduction To Reflective Journaling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the final activity of Unit 1 you will be asked to write a reflective journal entry in Obsidian on the topic of digital literacy. This entry can be used as part of Assignment 1: Reflective Journal.\nPrior to completing this activity, let’s discuss the practice of writing in a Reflective Journal.\nA reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning. Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings—whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun. The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course’s readings, activities, and discussions. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work. Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even beyond the prompting in course activities.\nWatch: Reflective Writing (2014)\n\nHere are some common questions used for reflective journaling. As you read them, consider what you have learned in this first unit.\n\nIn your view, what were the most important points in the readings or activities?\nWhat information did you already know? What skills did you already have?\nWhat new knowledge, skills, or perspectives have you gained?\nWhat information was easy to remember or learn? Why?\nWhat concepts or skills did you find more difficult? Why?\nHow can you apply this knowledge to your studies or future career?\nHow has this knowledge helped you to make sense of your current or previous experience?\nHas your understanding of a personal or work-related situation changed after studying these concepts?\nDid you agree or disagree with any of the material? If yes, how did you react and why?\nIf you could have the opportunity to engage in further learning, what would it be?\nWhat further questions would like to ask about the concepts presented in this unit?\nWhat other concepts, resources or discussions would be of interest?\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4 Activity: Digital Literacies for Online Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity you are asked to write a reflective journal entry on the topic of digital literacy.\n\nFirst, let’s get you set up in Obsidian. Click the little calendar icon in the sidebar of Obsidian to open today’s daily note.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Screenshot of the Daily Note Icon in Obsidian (Circled)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, respond to the following prompts:\n\nWrite your personal definition of digital literacies justified from your reading of the literature (about 100 to 150 words).\nDescribe what digital literacies mean for you in a sentence.\nCreate a link to your VR diagram map in your entry.\nSummarize an action plan for improving your digital literacies—identify the literacies you plan to improve including the reasons why and how you aim to achieve this.\nEnsure that your references are cited appropriately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This journal entry can be used to demonstrate your understanding of the course learning outcomes.

Properly citing your sources is vital in academic writing to avoid plagiarism, and we’ll introduce you to some of the principles of citing and referencing your work using the American Psychological Association’s style guide, known widely as APA. The current version of the APA style guide is 7, so you will often see references to APA7. Note that there are other style guides used in other disciplines, such as the Modern Languages Association guide (MLA), and the Chicago Manual of Style You’ll also gain practical experience with citation management tools to help streamline the citation process and manage your references efficiently.\nFinally, we’ll discuss the concept of openness in education. We’ll explore open educational resources (OER), the benefits and challenges of open access, and the role of Creative Commons licenses in educational materials. This discussion will open your eyes to the changing landscape of educational resources and the ethics surrounding them. Throughout these topics, you’ll engage in hands on activities, group projects, and discussions to enhance your critical thinking skills and promote responsible use of digital resources.",

    "section": "2.1 Finding and Selecting Resources",
    "text": "2.1 Finding and Selecting Resources\nThroughout your university career you will encounter tasks in your courses that will require you to produce some original writing. It is very important that you give yourself more time than you think you might need to complete these tasks. Good writing in university doesn’t just happen. It takes work. You will find that a large amount of that work isn’t actually writing at all, but reading. Then writing, and reading some more. Then rewriting, revising, editing, reading some more, and editing again.\nOne of the most important tasks in all of this is finding the resources you need to read, making sure they are academic resources, copying down all the information about the resource, then making sure you can keep track of what you have found, read, and learned. This unit will help you build a workflow for doing just that. You need a workflow and a system because there is far too much information available to you than you will ever be able to digest and read, let alone remember. It is impossible to memorize everything you need to know, so you need a way to manage your knowledge and resources.\nIn the previous unit, we introduced you to Obsidian, and you are going to continue to use Obsidian in this unit, but we will add some awareness of features that will take you along the path of becoming a workflow wizard. We will also introduce two new tools, Litmaps and Zotero, along with a couple of Zotero plugins that help extend the capabilities of the software. We will also integrate some knowledge of how to use the library to assist.\nWe recognize that we are introducing several tools to you and that may feel overwhelming, however, there are no tools that do everything that you need to do, and if a tool claims to be able to do everything it likely does only a few things well, and the rest is poorly implemented.\n\n2.1.1 Activity: Finding Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLitmaps is a web app that you can use to build a map of the literature regarding your topic. For now, presume that you need to write a paper on transformational servant leadership. That is a very broad topic, and you are only beginning to learn about it, so you need to start by doing some reading … but what should you read? Your instructor might have given you an article to read, or there are likely some good articles included in your course syllabus, but you might also have to start on your own.\nFollow the steps below as they explain how to conduct a literature review, introducing Litmaps as an invaluable tool.\n\n\n\nFind a Literature Review\nWhen academics begin writing a research paper they always start by reviewing what is already known about a subject, in this case, transformational servant leadership. This is called a literature review, and you can often find a section called literature review at the beginning of every article you read. Sometimes, though, the whole research article will be a literature review. Reviewing the literature in this way is sometimes called a systematic review, or maybe a scoping review. These approaches to literature reviews have different foci, but the intent is to publish an article that follows very specific procedures so that other researchers or learners can confirm the process. These types of reviews are very useful in getting started in a new topic.\nOne of the quickest ways to get started on a search is to use Google Scholar, but it has some problems in that it will return a huge number of results. Notice that the image below shows over 91,000 results. Far too many for you to sort through.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Screenshot, Results Page of Google Scholar Search for “Transformational Servant Leadership”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top result shows some promise though. Notice a few things about it:\n\nit has all your key words right in the title—that’s good\nit has over 2,700 citations (that’s very good)\nit was published in 2004 (that’s not great … it’s old)\n\nOne of the easiest ways to find literature reviews in Google searches is to include “literature review” in your search. When we do that, we get a better list. This time, there are more results (97,000), but they are better results. Notice the third item …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot, Results Page of Google Scholar search for “Transformational Servant Leadership Literature Review”\n\n\nall your keywords\nlots of citations\nmuch more recent (2019)\nAND it is a systematic review\n\nThis is the only article you need for now. Though search results are always changing, we will use this example (Eva et al., 2019) in our upcoming activity.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Screenshot of an Article Landing Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, you don’t even need to read this article yet. All you need is the DOI—the digital object identifier. A DOI is a critical piece of information about an article that provides a piece of evidence that this is a legitimate article published in a legitimate journal. A DOI will always start with 10. . Sometimes it is included as part of an URL, as in this case, but you only need the code that follows ‘10.’. The DOI for this article is 10.1016/j.leaqua.2018.07.004\n\nCopy the DOI. Sometimes you need to copy the whole URL, and that is ok.\nLog in to Litmaps.com and paste the DOI.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Screenshot of Litmaps Search Bar Populated with a DOI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will notice that LitMaps will be able to find the article and will present it as an option for you to click. Go ahead … click.\nLitMaps will create what they call a Seed Map, which you can see in the image below.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Screenshot of Litmaps Seed Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seed map shows an AI-generated map of the 20 most relevant articles related to the seed article. Each dot represents an article. The seed article is shown as a blue dot with a little sprout in the middle. The size of the dot is related to how many references are in the article (smaller dot = fewer references). Dots near the top of the map have more citations, and dots near the right side of the map are more recent. The map will always look like a bit of a waterfall, as older articles tend to have more citations. This map can be very helpful in finding very impactful, recent articles as those articles will be in the top right quadrant of the map.\nWhen you are signed in to LitMaps you are able to create collections of articles. To do this, click an article in the seed map, then read through the abstract. This might tell you that the article is not related to your search, but if it is, as in the image, then click “Edit Collections,”’ then “New Collection.” Give the new collection a name and click “Done.”\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Screenshot of Litmaps Seed Map with Edit Collections Popup (Circled)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, add Hoch, 2018, to your new collection (it is closest to the upper right quadrant), and finally add Greenleaf, 1979 (all the articles seem to cite this article, so it is likely very important in the field, sometimes called a seminal article).\n\nNotice that the articles you added to your new collection are all coloured the same as the collection.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Screenshot of Litmaps Seed Map Including “Discover” Option (Left)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, click “Discover” in the lefthand menu bar, then click “New Search,” then “Add from your Library.”\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Screenshot of Litmaps Seed Map Menu and “Discover” Link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Screenshot of Litmaps Seed Map “Add from Your Library” Link (Circled)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you are in the correct collection (your collection should show the Eva, Hoch, and Greenleaf articles you added), and click “Add 3 Inputs.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Screenshot of Litmaps Seed Map Including Collection Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen click “Find Related Articles.”\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Screenshot of Litmaps Seed Map Including Selected Articles and “Find Related Articles” on Bottom Left Menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will result in a new set of articles that are related to all three of your initial input articles. As you add more inputs, you will get a more refined result list until you have a nicely curated list of related articles.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Screenshot of Litmaps Seed Map Showing Articles Related to Those Previously Selected\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add an input article, click it in the map or list and choose “Add to Search,” then “Expand Search” to execute a new search with the new articles you added.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Screenshot of Litmaps Seed Map Showing Selected Article and “Add to Search” Button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Screenshot of Litmaps Seed Map with Additional Article Added\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that this search turned up another impactful article. Make sure to add that to your list!\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: Screenshot of Litmaps Seed Map Showing Additional Related Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, click “Your Library” and choose the library you just created. There should be eight or so references in the library. This is likely enough to synthesize into a short paper, but some disciplines may require more. Select all of the items in the library by clicking the checkbox that initially says “0 Selected,” then click the “Export” (download) icon on the right side of the screen.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: Screenshot of Litmaps Seed Map with Library Entries Selected\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose “RIS” in the dropdown menu, then click “Download.”\n\n\n\nFigure 2.16: Screenshot of Litmaps Seed Map Menu for Downloading Articles with RIS Format Selected\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more tutorials on using Litmaps, search online. For example, the Litmaps YouTube channel has some helpful videos.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Activity: Using LitMaps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose a research topic that interests you. (Tip: Consider the course you are taking or will take in the future.) What key topics do you want to learn more about? Here are some other links that may help you decide:\n\nChoosing a Topic: Purdue OWL (n.d.-b)\nBuilding Your Research Skills (2024)\nConduct a general internet search for “Topical issues in Business” or “Topical issues in Higher Education” and scan whether any of these issues are of personal interest.\n\nState your topic in the form of a question. For example:\n\nHow will robotics impact the future of work?\nWhat can businesses do to run successful loyalty programs?\nHow can technology prepare learners for a future that is increasingly defined within the context of globalization and technology?\nHow will mobile technology impact diagnosis and health care?\n\nReview your draft research question taking into account:\n\nPersonal interest: Does the research question interest you?\nSuitability for academic investigation: Some questions are not possible to answer through academic enquiry, for example, “How beautiful is the colour orange?” Identify a few keywords related to your proposed research question and conduct a general search to determine if there are published and accessible research outputs related to your question.\nAttainability: Make sure that your question can be answered in the amount of time you have. For example, “How do we solve global disease?” is too broad, whereas, “What is my neighbour’s favourite colour?” is too narrow. You will be looking to target between 8 to 15 scholarly references to prepare an annotated bibliography, including books, journal articles, and reputable website references . From those you will choose three for your annotated bibliography activity you will complete at the end of the unit.\nUse Litmaps to explore the literature on the topic of your choice.\n\nTake a screenshot of your Litmaps map and paste it to a journal entry in Obsidian. Reflect on your use of this tool. What was difficult to learn? How might you use this tool in your future studies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\nThis activity allows you to demonstrate your proficiency in the following course learning outcomes, as evaluated through the assignments:\n\nBuild and customize technology-integrated workflows to enhance and enrich your learning journey;\nApply digital literacy skills to evaluate the legitimacy, credibility and reliability of online resources for academic study;\nCreate a personalized narrative to document and express your learning process;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Activity: The TWU Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of your best advocates on campus or online are the librarians who work at the Norma Marion Alloway Library in Langley. They are extremely knowledgeable about finding things that are hard to find, so it is ALWAYS a good idea to talk to a librarian about what you are trying to do. They are literally paid to help you succeed! One of the ways they like to help is by creating what is known as a “LibGuide,” and we encourage you to access the LibGuides by selecting Research Guides on the library website.\nTake some time to browse the TWU Library. See if you can find the answer to the following questions:\n\nIs it possible to borrow or download an ebook?\nI’m a distance student. Can I request to have books or articles sent from the TWU Library to my location?\nDo you have books in languages other than English?\nDo you have ebooks?\nCan I email a Trinity Western librarian any time with my research questions?\nWhat is AskAway?\nWhat do I do if I have trouble logging in to library databases from off campus?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Activity: Advanced Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving search skills will save you time and result in more productive searches. Although we focus on LitMaps and the TWU Library in this course, another tool we want to share is the Google search engine. It provides a number of features to improve your searches in finding academic resources. In this activity, you will select two open resources using the Google advanced search operators in support of your research topic.\n\nRead the Google Search Cheatsheet for a more comprehensive list. Also see the Google Advanced Search Operators Cheat Sheet (n.d.) and try a few searches using the operators.\n\n\n\nUse the Google search operators (enter these directly into the search text area) to:\n\nidentify at least 10 PDF documents which have open educational resources in their title (are they all accessible for download?)\nfind a PDF version of the editorial entitled Scholarship and Literacies in a Digital Age (who are the authors?)\nFind the article with the following citation in text: the term digital literacies is contested with differing uses of the term revealing competing and even contradictory theoretical perspectives (who is the author?)\n\n\nVisit the Google Advanced Search web interface:\n\nconduct a search for digital literacies and scan the results\ngo back to the Google Advanced Search web interface and remove words from the search, for example “skills” or “school” and compare the results\nclick tools and find results for the date range 1 May 2020 to 1 May 2023\nclick images and find versions which are licensed for reuse with modification (useful when sourcing images for your course blog with the necessary legal permissions for reuse)\n\nOther Search Engines\nGoogle Scholar is a good search engine to find scholarly publications. The downside is that Google Scholar does not distinguish between closed and open resources. However, search results which show a PDF next to the listing will probably provide access to a full text version. Unpaywall is a free and legal way to identify authored–uploaded PDFs. There are extensions for the Chrome and Firefox open source browsers. Read the frequently asked questions for more information.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Activity: Database Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis activity focuses on searching database repositories. Most databases provide advanced search features; however there are differences in how each database site implements search functionality.\n\nView the following resources on searching using databases.\n\nTop Ten Database Search Tips (2011)\nSearching in Databases (2012)\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) – see also FAQs\n\nWatch the following video on using the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) (2016)\n\n\n\nUsing your keywords and synonyms generated for your research question, search for journal articles using the DOAJ search engine and BASE Advanced Search.\nAs appropriate, adapt your search by narrowing or expanding—remember to be flexible; if one term doesn’t work, try a different one.\nSelect a minimum of two resources, more if you like to save time later in the course.\nBased on the resources you find, think about whether you need to modify your research question.\n\nHow was your progress with this activity? Feel free to share your thoughts in Obsidian. For example:\n\nfinding resources for my topic was …\nI found … helpful.\ndatabase search tip: when …",

    "text": "2.2 Evaluating Resources\nA key part of finding and selecting resources is evaluating the resource. There is a great deal of information available on the internet. Some of it is very credible and useful. However, there is a lot of misinformation and poorly researched information online too. As you become more skilled at academic online searching and locating materials you will become quicker at determining what information is useful and credible.\nSo how do you evaluate sources to ensure those you are using are credible? The following technique, called the CRAAP test, will help you evaluate the sources you find.\nC - Currency R - Relevance A - Authority A - Accuracy P – Purpose\n\n2.2.1 Activity: Using the Craap Test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch How Library Stuff Works: How to Evaluate Resources (the CRAAP Test) (2015). This illustrates a set of steps you could take to evaluate sources.\n\n\nQuestions To Consider: After watching this video consider these questions:\n\nWhich part of the CRAAP test did you find most useful in evaluating sources?\nWhat following steps can you take when you evaluate any sources you find?\n\n\n\n\nReliability of Wikipedia\nWikipedia is the free online encyclopedia created through the collaborative effort of contributors from around the globe. Wikipedia is one of the most popular websites in the world. When conducting general internet searches Wikipedia articles will frequently be listed in the top results.\nAnyone registered on the Wikipedia site can create a new article page. Anyone can edit a Wikipedia article, and registration is not required to edit existing articles.\nThere have been a number of studies examining the accuracy of Wikipedia articles. Notwithstanding the outcomes of these studies, many educational institutions do not accept the use of Wikipedia as a credible source for academic writing and research. In this section we invite learners to evaluate whether Wikipedia is a trustworthy resource, and to form a justified opinion on its use as a reliable resource for academic writing.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Activity: Wikipedia: Why or Why Not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the following statement: Wikipedia is a reliable source for academic study.\nDo you agree? Have you cited Wikipedia in any academic work? Why or why not?\n\nRead the following:\n\nIs Wikipedia a Trustworthy Academic Resource? Scientists Think So published by EdTech Magazine.\nReliability of Wikipedia article on Wikipedia.\nShould University Students use Wikipedia? (2013)\nOptional reading annotations: Conduct a search for credible and reliable resources on the topic of the reliability and credibility of Wikipedia articles.\n\nWatch: Using Wikipedia for Academic Research (2011)\n\n\nDrawing on your study of the reliability and credibility of online resources, share your advice to fellow learners in this course regarding the use of Wikipedia for academic purposes by posting a comment on Discourse. For example:\n\nYou can use Wikipedia for … because …\nYou should not use Wikipedia for … because …",

    "section": "2.4 Openness in Education",
    "text": "2.4 Openness in Education\nAt this point in the unit you have used various tools to discover and curate resources. In this topic we would like to introduce you to a value in education that we believe is important for creating a true community of inquiry in higher education. If you haven’t already noticed from the title of this topic, we are thinking about openness. Here is a quick overview from the OER Foundation: Open Access Explained (2021).\nWatch: Open Access Explained \n\nAnd here is an article you can read (for free) from the British organization Wonkhe.\n\n\n\nOpen educational resources, or OER, refers to freely accessible and openly licensed educational materials that can be used, shared, and modified without cost. These resources include a variety of digital assets such as textbooks, lecture notes, multimedia content, and assessment tools. The key features of OER include their open licenses, which typically allow users to retain, reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute the content (Wiley, n.d.).\n\nThe 5 Rs of Openness\nRetain the right to make, own, and control copies of the content\nReuse the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)\nRevise the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)\nRemix the right to combine the original or revised content with other open content to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)\nRedistribute the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this material was created and published freely under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.\n\n\n\nWhy use OER? The usefulness of OER in higher education can be attributed to several compelling reasons:\n\nAffordability: OER mitigates financial barriers for students by providing access to educational materials at no cost. This is particularly significant as the high cost of traditional textbooks and learning resources can be a substantial financial burden for students.\nAccessibility: OER promotes equitable access to educational content globally. Anyone with an internet connection can benefit from OER, fostering inclusivity and addressing issues of accessibility in higher education.\nCustomized learning materials: Instructors can tailor OER to align seamlessly with course requirements, creating a personalized learning experience for students.\nCommunity collaboration: OER encourages collaborative knowledge sharing among educators and students, fostering a sense of shared learning within the academic community.\nCurrent and relevant content: the adaptable nature of OERs facilitates easy updates, ensuring educational materials reflect the latest advancements, and providing students with up-to-date information.\nGlobal perspectives: The inclusive design of OER integrates diverse global viewpoints, enhancing cultural awareness and expanding students’ understanding of various academic frameworks.\nEthical usage: OER operates with transparent licensing, ensuring ethical use of materials and upholding the principles of academic integrity.\n\nIn summary, OER offers a cost effective, flexible, and collaborative approach to educational resource development, making it a valuable and impactful asset in higher education. Its adoption aligns with the broader goals of enhancing accessibility, affordability, and inclusivity in the learning experience.\n\n\n2.4.1 Activity: Finding OERs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the Open Educational Resources Libguide from the TWU Library.\n\nWatch How to use OER (2012), then browse through the categories of OERs by discipline provided. Take some time to find an OER that relates to a topic that interests you.\n\n\n\nCreate an entry in Obsidian about an OER resource you found. Use the CRAAP test to evaluate it and explain why this resource interests you.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Activity: Advocating for OER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how do open educational resources affect you as a student? Why should you care? We’ve shared some of the benefits of openness in education, but there are several other reasons OER benefit students.\n\nWatch A Review of the Effectiveness & Perceptions of Open Educational Resources as Compared to Textbooks (2016)\n\n\n\nFor more information on OER Advocacy, see the chapter on How to Advocate on Your Campus in the OER Student Toolkit.\nCreate an entry in Obsidian about the benefits of OERs.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Activity: Reflecting on Your Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve reached the end of Unit 2, where you have explored several tools and practiced digital skills to help you find and select resources for academic study. As you have practiced the activities in this unit, you have curated resources about the topic of your choice. In this activity we ask you to write a paragraph about this topic, utilizing the resources you have found.\n\nRead this resource on how to write a good paragraph published by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For more writing tips see the Writing Resources website from the TWU Learning Commons.\nDraft a paragraph on an issue relating to your research topic. Your paragraph must contain:\n\na verbatim quote from one of your sources\na paraphrased fact from one of your sources\nUse the features of your citation management software to integrate:\nthe in-text reference for your verbatim quotation\nthe in-text reference for the paraphrased fact\nthe automatically generated reference list using APA style (consult the Quick APA Guide to review your formatting)\n\n\nGenerate a PDF version of your paragraph.\n\nPrepare a short journal entry of about 150 words sharing your experiences in using citation management software. For example: What worked well? Did you struggle with any of the instructions? Did you learn any new skills?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this reflection can be used for your assessment in this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Activity: Annotated Bibliography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity you will create an annotated bibliography related to a research topic of your choice.\n\nRead the following resources:\n\nEvaluating online sources: How to (Seriously) Read an Academic Paper (2016)\nPreparing an annotated bibliography: Writing an Annotated Bibliography (n.d.) and How to Write an Annotated Bibliography (2022)\nAnnotated Bibliography Samples: Purdue Owl (n.d.-a)\n\nNext, create an annotated bibliography in Obsidian for two sources—include a journal article and a book chapter from an edited collection of chapters by multiple authors.\n\nYou can select resources already saved in your library or search for new ones in support of your research topic.\nUse the note or comment feature of your citation management software to record a copy of your annotation.\nYou must use Zotero to generate the references using APA format.",

    "text": "3.1 Sense-making Through Hyperlinks\nIn higher education, your task is to build on the skills you bring from your previous experience and apply those skills in a much more focused field of study. Previously, you might have been able to succeed in school by having a great memory, but increasingly, you will be asked to do much more. You will be required to understand the theoretical basis of ideas (analysis) and also make connections between ideas to create new ideas (synthesis). This may feel challenging at first, but you will learn.\nOne of the challenges is that there is simply far too much information for you to analyze for any task that you might need to do for an instructor. In a previous unit, you learned some basic skills in finding and managing resources that you will need and in this unit, you will learn some ways to begin to analyze and synthesize information and documents in a systematic way.\nIf you learn this workflow well and learn how to customize it to your needs (that’s synthesis), you will be ahead of the game when it comes time to complete papers in other courses.\nThe key to this component of your workflow is the lowly hyperlink. You’ll know that if you click or tap that highlighted word you will be taken to another website, in this case, the Wikipedia article on hyperlinks. That is a hyperlink and it is the most basic unit of the entire internet, which is simply a massive collection of documents all linked together. At its most basic form, a hyperlink is simply a connection between two documents where a hyperlink in one document allows you to open the second document.\nIn this workflow instead of just linking two documents together you will link two ideas together (by linking documents). Your Obsidian vault is essentially a website that is only accessible on your computer; instead of links going to documents on other servers, you link to documents within the vault (although you can still link to the web).\n\nLinking in Obsidian\nThere are two methods of building hyperlinks in Obsidian: Wikilinks and markdown links, and we will cover both here.\n\nWikilinks\nA Wikilink, the default in Obsidian, is really simple to build. All you have to do is type two opening square brackets, like this [[, and Obsidian will do a couple things automatically. First, Obsidian will create the closing brackets to match, so you end up with this [[]], with your cursor in the middle, and second, Obsidian will present a list of all the pages in your vault, from which you can choose the page you want linked.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Screenshot, Create a Wikilink in Obsidian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you choose a page (in this case, article1.md), Obsidian will do the rest, and you will end up with this view:\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Screenshot, Wikilink Created in Obsidian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Hypothes.is you can create a link to Zotero. By pressing and holding the “Command” (macOS) or “CTRL” (Windows) button on the keyboard and then hovering over the link you’ve created, you will get a preview of the Zotero page. If you press and hold the “Command” (macOS) or “CTRL” (Windows) button on the keyboard and then click the link, you will be taken to the page. Once on the Zotero page, you can scroll to the bottom of the page and see “Backlinks” (a link back to the original page). If you don’t see backlinks, click the three dots in the top right corner of the page and choose “Backlinks in document.”\n\n\nMarkdown Links\nWhile Wikilinks are the default in Obsidian and are the easiest way to link within your vault, sometimes you might want to link to a site on the web. The syntax for a markdown link is a bit different but is still very simple. There are two parts you need to remember:\n\nthe link text (this is what you want your reader to see on your page)\nthe link URL (this is the web address of the site you want them to visit)\n\nHere is the syntax: [Link text between single square brackets](URL inside parentheses){target=\"_blank\"} So if you want someone to see the word “YouTube” on the page and for them to be taken to the YouTube website when they click the link, the syntax would be [YouTube](https://youtube.com){target=\"_blank\"} which will display like this: YouTube. Notice that there are no spaces between the closing square bracket and the opening parenthesis.\n\n\n\nWhy Link?\nCreating links to other related topics in your notes is a way that you can start to build connections in your mind about how different ideas are related. For example, if you are studying “trees,” you might want to link over to the previous notes that you created on “plants,” “forests,” or “climate change.” During your study on trees, you might want to create notes on “deciduous” and “coniferous” trees, or “xylem” and “phloem,” and link those articles to “trees.” By continually linking notes that are related you are creating a web of your knowledge as well as reminders of how ideas are related. Linking is a way for you to make sense of the information that is coming into your consciousness.\nOnce you have created links between different files in your vault you can visualize these links using the “Graph View” in Obsidian. Here is part of the graph view for a major paper. Each of the white dots represents a file in the vault, and their size is relative to the number of pages linked to that article. You can see that there are three really big pages that have many links. Those are clearly very important pages.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Screenshot, Graph View for Linked Documents in Obsidian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Activity: Link, Connect, and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the directions above to add notes to Obsidian on a topic of interest. Search online for interesting articles and videos you want to add to your notes and practice adding them using Wikilinks and markdown links. Locate the graph view in Obsidian to see the connections between the ideas you’ve added.\nAfter spending some time practicing this new skill, write a reflective journal entry on the process you followed and what your experience was like. What did you struggle with? How did you troubleshoot? What are the advantages of organizing your notes using this method?\n\nFeel free to discuss your experience on the Learning Hub in Discourse. You can also post any questions you have about this process and get technical support from your instructors and facilitators.",

    "section": "3.2 Sense-making Through Tags",
    "text": "3.2 Sense-making Through Tags\nA tag is a very short, descriptive word or phrase you can apply to an idea. You are likely familiar with the idea of a hashtag (#``) from various social media apps as a way to quickly find information on a specific topic. A tag in Obsidian works just like a hashtag in social media. If you type #trees on a file about trees, and then do the same on your pages about xylem, phloem, climate change, plants, forests, deciduous, and coniferous, you could click that tag on any one of those pages, and Obsidian will find every page that contains that tag.\nThis acts like a super-fast search of your notes for a particular topic or ideas related to a topic.\nWe recommend that you put your tags in the same spot on each page so you know where to find them. You can also put those tags at any place in your notes and Obsidian will show you the specific spot in your notes where the tag lives.\nYou can also show tags in your graph view, as below. Green dots are tags and white dots are files (as before). You can see in this image that there are many more connections.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Screenshot, Graph View in Obsidian Including Files (White Dots) and Tags (Green Dots)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can click any of the tags in Obsidian to see highlighted connections and search results for that tag, allowing you to go directly to notes of interest.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Screenshot, Graph View in Obsidian With Tag Expanded to Show Additional Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing links and tags together you can build a very powerful and easily searchable vault of all the ideas in your courses. This can be incredibly valuable when it is time to write a paper or prepare for an exam—you can have all your notes easily accessible rather than having to search through pages and pages of handwritten notes.\n\n3.2.1 Activity: Tag, Link, Connect, and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the directions above to add tags to your notes in Obsidian. Again, spend some time on this. The more you practice, the easier the process will be. More than that, as you continue to use tags and links, you will be able to experience the advantages of connecting your ideas using this method.\nAdd to your Reflective Journal your thoughts and experience on using tags. What were your struggles or “ah-ha” moments? What questions do you have?\n\nRemember to reach out for support on the Learning Hub in Discourse.",

    "text": "3.3 Sense-making Through Concept Maps\nAs you saw at the beginning of this unit, sense-making is the work of learning. There is no way around the work of learning because learning is work. It takes time and cognitive effort. As much as we wish to be able to “learn” like Neo in The Matrix, we can’t (see a favourite scene in a movie, below; and it’s not just because Keanu Reeves is the GOAT 🐐).\n\nWatch The Matrix - ‘I Know Kung Fu’ (2019)\n\n\nTags and links in Obsidian can be visualized using graph view, but as this is an algorithmically generated map of the connections between ideas and files in your vault, there is little you can do to customize it. Fortunately, Obsidian also features a tool called the Canvas, which is a blank space that you can use to manually connect ideas in a visual format, allowing you to see connections and relationships that make sense to you. The following video is a brief explanation of how to use the Canvas in Obsidian.\n\n3.3.1 Activity: Obsidian Concept Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Mind Mapping in Obsidian Canvas (2023). As you watch, follow the directions to create a concept map in Obsidian. At the end of this unit, you will create a concept map for Units 1-3.

You will also have the opportunity to practice using the Markdown markup language. Semantic markup is an important digital skill that separates formatting (e.g., headings, bold, italics, lists) from content, using designated characters without the use of rich text editors. This provides the capability to use plain text files that can be converted to formatted text online. Markdown is one of many such markup protocols and is used here to demonstrate the principles of semantic markup.\n\n3.4.1 Activity: Reading and Note Taking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the following articles and take notes in Obsidian.

    "text": "4.1 Personal Learning Environments\nThis unit aims to guide you in creating your Learning Blog, the central component of your personal learning environment (PLE). Blog posts serve as reflections on your learning journey and facilitate networking with peers. Your blog also provides your instructor with valuable insights into your course engagement and learning process. Ultimately, the goal of a PLE is to put the learner at the centre of the online learning environment.\nSo What is a Personal Learning Environment?\nPersonal Learning Environments [are] systems that help learners take control of and manage their own learning. This includes providing support for learners to set their own learning goals, manage their learning; managing both content and process, communicate with others in the process of learning, and thereby achieve learning goals. A PLE may be composed of one or more sub-systems: As such it may be a desktop application, or composed of one or more web-based services. (van Harmelen, 2007, as cited in Edutech Wiki, 2014, Definitions, para. 2)\n\nWhich aspects of the two definitions do you find most meaningful? How do you structure your daily interactions and manage the flow of information? In what ways do you communicate your learning experiences to others? Lastly, what specific goals are you aiming to accomplish through your learning journey?\n\n4.1.1 Activity: What Is a PLE?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you start building your PLE, read the following article: “7 Things you Should Know About Personal Learning Environments. After reading the article, consider the following:\n\nHow do PLEs promote authentic, student-centred learning?\nWhat are the benefits of a PLE? How would it benefit you?\nWhat tools do you currently use as part of your learning environment?\n\nNext, consider the approach taken at TWU as it supports inquiry-rich learning. As you watch the short video below, think about how you could use your PLE to enrich your learning at TWU.\n\nWatch: Inquiry-Rich Learning (2018) \n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Activity: What Is Your PLE?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a couple of minutes to brainstorm the tools, services, and communities that you use to pursue your educational goals. Use your notetaking tool (e.g., Obsidian) to create a list of these.\nNext, create a graphic organizer to visualize your PLE. You can use Obsidian, or see Best Graphic Organizers for Education (2023) for other free options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that you completed a Visitor and Resident Diagram Activity in Unit 1. Feel free to use that graphic organizer and add other tools you use for learning, or that you have been introduced to in this course.\nYou will be encouraged to post your PLE graphic on your blog … which you will start in the next activity!",

You will “declare” yourself online using your PLE as an alternative to posting an introduction in a closed course forum typically used in a conventional online course. Note that TWU online courses often use Moodle Discussion Forums to facilitate conversations. By using a platform such as WordPress you can retain the contents of your posts as well as the comments of your peers. In a learning management system (LMS) such as Moodle you may lose access to what you have posted in discussions, and more importantly, conversations with your peers. As you create your personal blog in WordPress (or your own selective blog site), you control your data and who can see it.\nYou will retain control of your data and learning outputs generated during this online course, even after the course is completed. You get to choose:\n\nThe blog service you would like to use, although we recommend WordPress as it is supported by TWU\nWhether to accept comments on your blog from your peers\nWhether to register your blog for the aggregated course feed so that any posts tagged with the course code (LDRS101) will be harvested for the feed\n\nA key teaching philosophy of this course is to embed the acquisition of new digital literacies into your learning journey. Knowledge of how to use the internet and social media technologies will better prepare you for life in a digital world. If this is your first time blogging, you should spend time setting up your personal digital learning environment. Please remember that your learning blog and the social media technologies you use on this course are public, and that you take full responsibility for anything you publish. Do not disclose any confidential information and respect the privacy of others. In short, don’t say anything that you would not want to read on the internet.\n\n4.2.1 Activity: Setting up Your Learning Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this is a course focusing on digital literacies, you are asked to establish a Learning Blog, which will improve your skills and enable you to network with your peers. We recommend using WordPress, as it is supported by TWU. WordPress is an open source website builder and is one of the most popular systems available because of its versatility. If you already have your own website or you have previous experience using WordPress, you may set up your blog on it and skip the set-up steps described below, but you still need to complete the learning activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are here to help you create your site, so do not hesitate to ask for technical support. There are a number of resources below, but if you get stuck, please reach out on Discourse, or email elearning@twu.ca\n\n\n\nTo get started on creating your site we suggest the following steps:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        1. Sign up to create a website\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \nGo to create.twu.ca to sign up for your\nfree WordPress site. Please read all the prompts and instructions\ncarefully! Be sure to read the Privacy Statement carefully before\nclicking “I Agree.” The information provided gives you excellent\nguidance regarding digital citizenship, privacy, and how to build a\nprofessional digital persona.\nYou will be prompted to create a domain name, which\nis your website’s address on the internet. Often this is referred to as\na URL (Uniform Resource Locator). This is what your users will type in\ntheir browsers to reach your site. Make sure that you choose a domain\nname that is related to you, easy to pronounce and spell, and easy to\nremember. Once you have done that, we suggest you write all this\ninformation somewhere you can access it easily—just in case.\nYou will also be asked to select a theme for your\nwebsite. You are free to choose any template you wish.\nWhen you choose your theme, your new site will come with a simple\nmenu and instructions for portfolio and website creation.\nOnce you have activated your site (look for a notification in your\nTWU email) you are ready to create.\n\n      \n    \n  \n      \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        2.

From the menu item\nthat is the name of the blog (second from left), you can find the link\nto the dashboard. While in the dashboard, the same menu can be used to\nreturn to the front view of your site.\nDetermine the difference between the dashboard used for editing and\nthe published view of your blog. (It is important to know the difference\nbecause when you register your blog for the course feed, you must use\nthe URL for the public view of your blog).\n\nProgress check:\n\nDo you know how to open the published (public view) of your blog in\na new window?\nHave you added a browser bookmark to your dashboard and the public\nversion of your blog?\n\nHelp Tips: When you are in the site administration\narea of your site, you can get tips on what you are doing by clicking\nthe “Help” menu on the top righthand corner. Click “Help” and read\nthrough the Overview describing the elements of the dashboard.\n\n      \n    \n  \n      \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        3. Review your settings\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Review and customize your blog settings from the dashboard according\nto your preferences.\n\nEnable categories and tags: We recommend that\nyou enable categories and tags on your\nblog. Categories are best used for broad groupings of\ntopics. For example, if you’re creating a site that reviews pop culture\nyou might use categories such as books, film, and TV.\nTags are more specific keywords that you want to use to\nassociate related content. For example, if you were creating a site that\nreviews pop culture you might want to use tags such as science fiction,\nhorror, and action adventure.You can combine the two! For our review\nsite example, you might be reviewing a romantic comedy. You can assign\nthe broader category “film” to the post, then give it some more specific\ntags such as romantic comedy, or even use the name of the actors and\ndirector as tags. People who view that post could use the tags to find\nrelated posts around that topic.\nSet up comments settings (optional): WordPress\ncomes with a built-in comment system allowing your users to leave\ncomments on your posts. This comment system is great for user\nengagement, but it can also be targeted by spammers as well. If you\ndon’t want comments on your posts ensure that the “Allow comments” box\nis unchecked at the bottom of the editor page. If you do want comments,\nbut want to manage the spam you’ll need to enable comment moderation on\nyour website. Visit Settings » Discussions page and scroll down to\n“Before a comment appears” section. Check the box next to the “Comment\nmust be manually approved” option.\n\n      \n    \n  \n      \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        4. Personalize your blog\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Visit the appearance option on your dashboard and personalize your\nblog by:\n\nChanging your theme, header image, background colours, and/or\nimage\nAdding at least one widget to your blog. Remember—“less is more.”\nOne or two of the following are functional choices: archives, recent\nposts, categories or category cloud, and “blogs I follow.”\nBe sure to save your changes!\n\n      \n    \n  \n      \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        5. Add a page and a post\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Pages and posts are where your content is housed on WordPress. The\nbiggest difference between the two is that posts are timestamped,\nwhereas pages are timeless.\n\nPages are for static content. They do not need a\npublish date. Use pages when you want your visitors to always be able to\nsee that content in that spot, no matter when they visit.\nPosts are for timely content. They have a\npublish date, and they are displayed with the newest content at the top\n(reverse chronological order) of your site’s blog page. Older posts can\n“fall off” the blog page (the content is still kept, but no longer\nvisible). Posts are what you should think of when you hear the term\n“blog post.” Usually posts have a comment section, and this is where\nviewers can write a comment in response to your post. This may be a\nhandy way to receive feedback from your peers. Also, you can categorize\nor tag your posts, which is useful to help readers locate posts on your\nblog.\nTo add a new Page or Post, click the Pages or Posts menu option\nand then click “Add New Link” underneath. Another way is to hover your\ncursor over Pages or Posts and click the add new link in the drop-down\nmenu.\n\n\nBLOG CHALLENGE!\n\nEdit a Page: Complete your personal details for\ndisplay on the “About” page of your blog.\n\nProgress check: Can you see the updates on your “About”\npage in the published view of your blog?\n\nEdit a Blog Post: Reflect on your experience of\nthis activity on creating a blog. Click “Save Draft” (so you can review\nbefore publishing live on the web). Your reflection could for example:\n\nIntroduce yourself and reflect on what you would like to achieve by\nmaintaining a blog to support your learning.\nReflect on what you thought of the activity—was it easy or\nhard?\nShare links to any additional resources you found useful in\ncompleting the tasks.\nProvide tips for future learners who will be completing this\nactivity. If you were to set up a new blog again, what would you do\ndifferently?\nAdd anything your readers may find interesting or useful.\n\n\n      \n    \n  \n      \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        6. Add media\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \nUsing different types of media to represent your artifacts is a\ngreat way to make your portfolio dynamic and keep your audience engaged.\nText-heavy pages can get cumbersome, regardless of how you arrange them.\nAdding media can help by breaking up content or replacing text all\ntogether. Consider how you can “show what you know” rather than just\nsimply telling. Media can also be an alternative to simply hyperlinking\nall your artifacts. Instead of sending your audience off to another site\nor tab, media can be embedded (see Media Library) to keep your audience contained to\nyour page.\nThe Media Library on your WordPress site houses the media you upload\nto your site. WordPress supports a variety of media types such as\nimages, audio, video, and documents. We do suggest that you host your\nvideo files in your TWU Microsoft Stream account for optimal\nplayability. Other types of media are typically uploaded and inserted\ninto the text editor when writing a post or page.\n\nBLOG PHOTO CHALLENGE!\n\nChoose a photo to add to your blog post. Be sure\nyou have permission to upload the photo. We suggest using an open\nlicense site such as Pixabay, Unsplash, Pexels, Wikimedia Commons, or Flickr. Alternatively, upload your own photo, take a\nselfie, or ask someone to take a photo of you working on this blog post\nchallenge. You might find the following videos helpful:\n\nHow to Add an Image to a WordPress Website\n(2017)\nHow to Add Featured Images in WordPress (2017)\n\n\nBLOG VIDEO CHALLENGE!

    "section": "4.3 My Digital Footprint",
    "text": "4.3 My Digital Footprint\nNow that you have created your learning blog and introduced yourself online let’s take a closer look at the information about you available on the internet. Imagine if potential employers were to search for you online. What would they discover, and what would you prefer them to find? As we examine online identities in this topic, we will ask you to consider how you can improve your digital identity in support of your online learning, as well as future employment prospects.\nFirst, let’s clarify some key terms.\nWe need to distinguish between the technical and human elements of online identity. In this course we are more interested in the human side of online identity, but in part, this is determined by how technology automates the process of building your digital footprint.\nDigital identity refers to the information utilized by computer systems to represent external entities, including a person, organization, application, or device. When used to describe an individual it encompasses a person’s compiled information and plays a crucial role in automating access to computer-based services, verifying identity online, and enabling computers to mediate relationships between entities. Digital identity for individuals is an aspect of a person’s social identity and can also be referred to as online identity. (“Digital Identity,” 2024)\nDigital footprint or digital shadow refers to one’s unique set of traceable digital activities, actions, contributions, and communications manifested on the internet or digital devices. Digital footprints can be classified as either passive or active. The former is composed of a user’s web browsing activity and information stored as cookies. The latter is often released deliberately by a user to share information on websites or social media. While the term usually applies to a person, a digital footprint can also refer to a business, organization or corporation. (“Digital Footprint,” n.d.)\n\n4.3.1 Activity: What Is a Digital Footprint?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch What is a Digital Footprint? (2021) and consider the steps you would take to control your digital footprint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Activity: Who Am I Online … and Why Should I Care?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the following:\n\nUnderstanding Your Online Identity (2017)\nHow To Manage Your Digital Footprint in 2024: 20 Tips for Students (2022)\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nHow does your real world identity differ from your online identity?\nWhat factors inhibit or support the sharing of information in building an online identity?\nWhat is the value of an online identity for learning?\n\nReminder: As you view online resources in this course, feel free to annotate and discuss web resources publicly in support of your learning (e.g., using digital tools such as Hypothes.is, Discourse, WordPress, or others).\nIn addition to evaluating who you are online, ask yourself, “why should I care?”\n\nWatch Four Reasons to Care About Your Digital Footprint (2016), and then select from the resources below to inform your views.\n\n\n\nStudents Turn to Internet to Build Online Presence, Showcase Work (2013)\nYour Online Presence and Your Career (n.d.)\nDigital Tattoo Project (n.d.)\nPolicy Brief: Privacy (2015)\n\nFinally, consider how much someone could find out about you from your digital footprint. Here’s an interesting video that might cause you to reconsider what you post online.\n\nAmazing Mind Reader Reveals his ‘Gift’ (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Activity: Digital Footprint Audit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity you will audit your own digital footprint in order to find out what exists on the internet about you and reflect on what you want your online identity to be. Follow the steps below to begin.\n\nConduct a Google search of your own name (using an incognito or private window in Chrome or Firefox). Search for your first name and surname without quotation marks (e.g., snow white) and then with quotation marks (e.g., “snow white”). Explore the results of your search.\nConduct a Google search of your name with the name of current and previous employers.\nConduct a Google search of your name with the name of previous schools you attended.\nExpand your search to include social media sites, for example, “snow white” twitter; “snow white” Facebook; “snow white” YouTube.\nNote any interesting or surprising findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Activity: Blog: My Digital Footprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepare and publish a short blog post of about 250 to 300 words focusing on what you hope to achieve with your online digital identity for learning.\n\nReflect on the outcomes of your footprint audit. You don’t need to be specific; for example, you can generalize: “I am satisfied with my digital footprint because …” or “I would like to improve my digital footprint for learning because …”\nReflect on professional versus private identities. Consider how you want to separate your “private” online identity from your professional or learning identity. If you already maintain an online presence (existing blog or social media accounts) think about how you will separate professional or learning posts from private and social life interactions online. For example, maintaining a separate course or learning blog is one way to achieve this distinction. Will you link your personal online identities (e.g., an existing X (formerly Twitter) username or Facebook account) with your learning blog? Will you link your professional online identity (e.g., published online biography or resume) with your learning blog?\nList a few objectives for developing or improving your online identity.\nAdd a category or tag to your post using the course tag: LDRS101 (this is needed to harvest links to posts from registered blogs for the course feed).\n\nRemember: You are in charge of what you post online and you decide what you would like to share for your digital identity for the purposes of this course. Don’t share high risk personal details such as your physical address, date of birth, name of first pet, and so on which may make it easier for identity thieves to appear more credible. If unsure, consult online resources for internet safety; for example Get Cyber Safe (2021) from the Government of Canada.",

    "section": "4.4 Evaluating Digital Tools",
    "text": "4.4 Evaluating Digital Tools\nSo far in Unit 4, you have created a learning blog in WordPress, explored your social media platforms, and used a range of other tools such as Zotero, Discourse, Obsidian, and more.\nAs we step into this new topic, we encourage you to engage in a critical examination of the online tools you use or are interested in. Beyond the basic considerations of functionality and user friendliness, we invite you to assess digital tools, platforms, and interactions through the lens of ethical principles.\nSo how do we evaluate technology on ethical principles? Here are some guiding questions from Ethical EdTech:\nGuiding Questions\n\nWhere does power lie, and where are we expected to place our trust?\nTo whom is it accessible—for instance, in terms of usability and cost?\nDoes it lock us into closed, commercial systems or invite us into open communities?\nDoes it give us more control over the learning process, or does it cede that control?\nDoes it respect and protect our privacy appropriately?\nCan we access, study, and modify the underlying code or design?\nWho owns the infrastructure and our usage data? Does it produce private profit or public commons?\n\nThese crucial questions highlight the importance of privacy, data ownership, and accessibility. What other questions would you ask to ensure a tech tool is ethical?\n\n4.4.1 Activity: What Are My Criteria?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the following Tool Evaluation Criteria. Note some criteria may not apply to the tool you choose to evaluate. Also see the Tool Evaluation Scoring Rubric and Notepad (an editable Google Sheet).\n\n\n\nCreate your own criteria for evaluating digital tools. Set up a spreadsheet or notepad (in Obsidian for example) and as you list your criteria, consider why that detail is important to you. To help you select your criteria, read the following:\n\nPolicy Brief: Privacy (2015)\n\n\nThis next website might be a bit of an eye-opener. You may want to browse through some common tech examples and see their score. - Terms of Service. Didn’t Read (n.d.)\nFinally, read the following questions and consider what you want to add to your rubric considering the context of the tool, the terms of service, and the purpose.\nBusiness Context\n\nWho owns the tool?\nWho is the tool maker or CEO?\nWhat are their politics? Does that matter?\nWhat is the tool’s history?\nHow do they market themselves?\nHow does the company generate revenue?\nWhat is their market position in/point of difference?\nWho are the competitors?\nWhat do others say about the product? Are these sources reliable?\n\nTerms of Service\n\nWhat are the terms of service? Are they easy to find?\nWhat personal data is required to use the tool (username, real names, email, date of birth, and so on)?\nWho owns the data?\nHow is the data protected?\nWhere is the data housed?\nWhat flexibility do users have to be anonymous?\nDoes the tool support open licensing of user generated content?\nHow is copyright infringement managed?\nHow is user generated content distributed by the company? What license does the user give the company for distributing to third parties?\nCan users delete their accounts or leave the service?\nCan users export their data? What export formats are supported?\nHow is personal information managed?\nCan information be shared with third parties, and if so under what conditions?\nCan the company terminate a users account? Under what conditions?\nHow are changes to the terms of service managed?\n\nFit For Purpose\n\nIs the tool suitable for the stated purpose?\nHow does the design of the tool influence what users can do with the tool?\nDoes the tool provide support resources or help tutorials? Search the web to find out if others provide help and advice on using the tool (for example YouTube, blog posts, and so on)\nWhat are the implications or opportunities of the tool to support learning in a digital age?\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Activity: Evaluate a Digital Tool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity, you are invited to critically evaluate an online tool.\n\nSet Your Goals: As you select the tool you want to evaluate consider your goals for improving your digital skills.\n\nWhat do you want to do or learn online?\nWhat skills are needed in your academic area and profession?\nWhat tool would be helpful for you and your peers to know more about?\n\nChoose a Tool: Select any online tool or choose one from the list below.\n\nBlogging: Blogger, WordPress, Medium, Tumblr\nFile sharing: Dropbox, Nextcloud, MediaFire, Google Drive, SugarSync\nPresentations: Haikudeck, Prezi, Google Slides, Slides (using Reveal.js)\nOnline collaboration: Basecamp, Slack, Rocket.chat, Hipchat\nVideo conferencing: jitsi, Anymeeting, Zoom, GoToMeeting, Microsoft Teams\nFeed aggregators: Feedly, Panada, NewsBlur, Inoreader, Feedreader\nProject management: Trello, Kanboard, Freedcamp, Asana, Notion, GitHub\n\nEvaluate the Tool: Use your chosen rubric or guiding questions to complete your review.\nShare Your Insights: Prepare a blog post (about 450–600 words) where you publish a critical review of your selected tool. Your blog post must:\n\nState your intended purpose for the tool\nHighlight strengths and weaknesses (company reputation, software features, terms of service, and so on)\nInclude hyperlinks to appropriate web pages\nInclude references using APA style if required\nInclude if applicable a disclaimer or disclosure; that is, whether you have any association with the company or tool that may impact on the review\nInclude concluding recommendation(s)\nInclude a comment on whether the tool is fit for your stated purpose\nInclude a comment on the extent to which the tool would be useful for learning in a digital age\nAdd a category or tag for your post using the course tag: LDRS101\n\n\nOn Discourse, let us know what tool you selected and why. Share the link of your review blog.",

    "section": "5.1 Digital Citizenship",
    "text": "5.1 Digital Citizenship\nBefore attempting to define digital citizenship, let’s consider the concept of citizenship in its own right. In its simplest form, citizenship refers to the rights, privileges, and duties of being a national citizen. However, the concept of being a good citizen encompasses much more, particularly if you think about full engagement as a member of society.\n\nCitizenship is a status that is bestowed on those who are full members of a community. (Marshall, 1950)\n\n\n5.1.1 Activity: Reflecting on Digital Citizenship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf good citizenship means fulfilling your role as citizen, can you think of five things good citizens do?\n\nConsider the following questions while you read the resources below:\n\nIn a digital world, is loyalty to your country a necessary component of the definition of good citizenship?\nIs education a prerequisite for good citizenship?\nIn a digital world, what does it mean to be a global citizen? Read the Wikipedia article on Global Citizenship Education (2024), where learners engage in solving real world problems.\nHas the concept of good citizenship changed over time? In what ways?\nDoes citizenship require active community engagement? Read this post by Kristen Mattson, director of a high school library media center: John Dewey Would Hate Your Digital Citizenship Curriculum (2016). Why has the concept digital been linked with citizenship or should we drop the word digital and just talk about good citizenship?\n\nWrite your thoughts in your journal (using Obsidian or WordPress). Conclude by writing a description of digital citizenship in your own words. (You will need this later for your Digital Citizenship Blog assessment. It does not need to be a scholarly definition—just your personal thoughts on the concept.)\n\n\n\n\nDefining Digital Citizenship\nDefining digital citizenship is not easy because it means different things to different people. It is also a concept which is debated among scholars researching the field.\nIf you conduct a general search for “digital citizenship” you will find many links referencing resources targeting elementary and high school levels with a focus on safe, skilled, and ethical use of online technology. While these aspects are important, for the purposes of this tertiary-level course, we need to explore the concept of digital citizenship in more detail.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Activity: Podcast on Digital Citizenship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity you will listen to a podcast that focuses on the people dimension of digital citizenship.\n\nMeet Autumm Caines, associate director of academic technology from the Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching at Capital University, speaking in a podcast with Bonni Stachowiak.\nListen to the first 15–20 minutes of this Teaching in HigherEd (2016) podcast on digital citizenship. The podcast introduces aspects of digital citizenship and the learner experience in starting out with engagement with social media.\n\n\n\n\nGuiding Framework\nCaines (2016) provides a useful framework for thinking about digital citizenship:\n\nDigital identities: that is, who you are online including the identities of others (individuals and organizations)\nDigital environments: specifically the tools and online spaces we use to interact with each other; for example, Facebook, Discourse, X, blogs, forums, and so on.\nInteractions: between these identities and environments\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Model for Digital Citizenship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: From “Digital Citizenship,” by A. Caines, 2016, August 25, Teaching in Higher Ed Podcast. CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Activity: Refined Definition of Digital Citizenship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this activity is to explore the elements of digital citizenship with particular emphasis on those relevant to your academic study.\nRead through the following resources in order to refine your own definition of what it means to be a digital citizen.\n\nOnline search:\n\nRead the introductory section of the Wikipedia article Digital Citizen (2024).\nConduct a general search for “definition of digital citizen.” Choose the two best definitions and add these to the library of your citation management tool (Zotero or Obsidian),or keep a record for citation purposes.\nLocate one recent scholarly definition for “digital citizen.” Record the reference for citation purposes. How recent is the reference?\n\nSocial media search:\n\nExplore recent tweets or posts (on X or whichever social media app you prefer) using the following hashtags: #digitalcitizenship, #digiciz, and #digicit. Compile a list of elements relating to the concept of digital citizenship.\n\nRead and identify:\n\nRead Nine Themes of Digital Citizenship (2023), and search for other academic articles on digital citizenship using Google Scholar, LitMaps, or the TWU Library.\nGenerate a table listing the nine elements of digital citizenship and identify a practical example of each element for your academic study. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement\nAcademic Study Example\n\n\n\n\nDigital access\nStudents from low income countries may not have reliable or affordable access to the Internet.\n\n\nDigital commerce\n\n\n\nDigital communication\n\n\n\nDigital literacy\n\n\n\nDigital etiquette\n\n\n\nDigital law\n\n\n\nDigital rights and responsibilities\n\n\n\nDigital health and wellness\n\n\n\nDigital security\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter completing the steps above, revise your personal description of digital citizenship. Does your new definition differ from your initial description?\nShare a reflection on this activity by posting either in your blog or on Discourse. For example:\n\nI didn’t realize the … is part of digital citizenship because …\n… is not particularly relevant for university learners because …\n… is particularly relevant for university learners because …\n\n\n\n\n\nRights and Responsibilities\nThe concept of citizenship encompasses the rights and responsibilities of individuals. We need to consider what rights and responsibilities come with digital citizenship. In this next activity, we explore this topic with particular emphasis on the rights and responsibilities associated with learning in a digital age.\nFollowing the hype of massive open online courses (MOOC) and the New York Times declaring 2012 the “year of the MOOC,” a small group of educators drafted A Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in a Digital Age (Ng, 2013). This document forms the basis for a course discussion on the rights and responsibilities of digital citizens.\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Activity: Rights and Responsibilities of Digital Citizens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConduct a general search for rights and responsibilities of digital citizenship to assist in refining your own list for university online study. Your search is likely to generate many results developed for the school sector, so you need to evaluate whether these rights and responsibilities are appropriate for you.\nRead the following and then conduct a search through the TWU library for digital rights and responsibilities.\n\nA Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in the Digital Age (2013)\nDigital Rights and Responsibility in Education: A Scoping Review (2024)\n\nPrepare a table summarizing the primary rights and responsibilities for university learning in a digital age.\nDrawing on your knowledge and experience, join the discussion on Discourse regarding rights and responsibilities for learning in a digital age at TWU. You can discuss the topical issues listed below or add new ones to the forum. In each case, justify your position, taking opposing views into account.\n\n&lt;!-- deleting 'Bill of Rights' Seeks to Protect Students' Interests as Online Learning Rapidly Expands (2013) & Critique of 'Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in the Digital Age (2013)\n@chloe how does this work with Zotero?  Should I delete from the library? \n\nOn another issue - I want to add this video to the beginning of this activity, but the formatting isn't quite working.  please embed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpNeavL0Dfw\n\n- Watch the Your Digital Rights and Responsibilities| Being a Good Digital Citizen\n\n--&gt;\nTopical Issues\n\nShould higher education institutions have the right to determine what software applications learners should use for their studies?\nData generated by learners belongs to the learners, therefore should they have the right to access their data (for example forum discussion contributions) even after the course is completed?\nWhere legally permissible, should learners have the right to access all course materials without the need to register a password?\nOthers?\n\nWe encourage you to reply and to “like” posts on Discourse. Remember to tag your posts using key words to facilitate searches (e.g. digital-rights).\n\n\n\nPersonal and Professional Identity\nIn short, digital citizenship is about being a person on the web. In the previous unit on building your online presence we noted that individuals portray different personas online; for example, personal, academic, and professional.\nOn the one hand, we need to be careful about what we post online because this can have a negative impact on future career prospects or current employment. We must also be cognizant of the different limitations that various careers place on what can be shared publicly and what needs to stay private. On the other hand, building a strong learning or professional network online is very powerful in staying up to date with new trends and establishing connections with your peers.\nIn this section, we reflect on the balance between public and private in a digital world, recognizing that this is going to be different for each person depending on their own environments and professional circumstances. We will also explore how like-minded professionals in your field of interest network online.\n\nThe … impact exercised by ICTs is due to at least four major transformations: “the blurring of the distinction between reality and virtuality,” “ the blurring of the distinction between human, machine and nature,” “the reversal from information scarcity to information abundance,” and “the shift from the primacy of stand-alone things, properties, and binary relations, to the primacy of interactions, processes and networks. (Floridi, 2015, p. 2)\n\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Activity: Professional Online Identity and Digital Citizenship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity we will explore professional online identity and networking in the field of your choice.\n\nFirst, scan the following resources:\n\nHigh Court Rules Public Servants can be Sacked for Political Social Media Posts (2019)\n’Think of Social Media as a Virtual Resumé, Expert Warns in Light of Health Board Resignation (2017)\nYou can also search online using the terms “fired over tweet” or “social media firing cases.”\n\nWatch the short video Watch: Using Twitter effectively in education - with Alec Couros Couros summarizes how educators are using Twitter (now X) to connect professionally.\n\nWatch: Using Twitter effectively in education - with Alec Couros \n\n\nFinally, visit the LinkedIn help page on finding and joining a LinkedIn group.\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter completing the activities above answer the following questions:\n\nHow do like-minded professionals in your career or future career, field, or discipline network online (e.g., X, LinkedIn groups, other websites)?\nWhat hashtags, if any, are being used for conversations in your chosen field?\nWhat are the topical areas of discussion at the moment?\nHow could your field of interest improve professional networking online?\n&lt;!– delete bullet point. Delete in Zotero too?\nDo organizations in your field place restrictions on employees participating in social networks? (See for example Corporate Social Media Policies: The Good, the Mediocre, and the Ugly (2010a), and More Social Media Policies: LA Times, Harvard Law, Microsoft, and Cisco (2010b).–&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.6 Activity: Blog: Professional Online Identity and Digital Citizenship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepare a short blog post (about 300–400 words) summarizing your findings on professional online networking in your field of interest. Consider the following questions:\n\nHow do like-minded professionals in your field network online and what do they talk about?\nWhat does this mean for your online identity and being a digital citizen?\n\nFeel free to share your blog post with others on Discourse and/or in your professional learning network. Reply and “like” posts on Discourse, using key tag words to facilitate searches (e.g. digital-rights).\n\n\n\n\n5.1.7 Activity: Blog: My Online Biography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this challenge you are asked to build or update your professional online biography and the “About” page of your course blog.\n\nReflect on the following online personas, target audiences, and how these will impact on the style and voice of the communication medium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersona\nPrimary audience\n\n\n\n\nPersonal\nFriends and family\n\n\nProfessional\n(Future) Employers and professional network\n\n\nAcademic\nPeer learning network\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the most appropriate medium for each of your online personas, for example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersona\nMedium example\n\n\n\n\nPersonal\nFacebook\n\n\nProfessional\nLinkedin\n\n\nAcademic\nLearning blog or website\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify one or two professionals from your field of interest who maintain an active web presence and contribute regularly via social media. Explore their respective websites and professional listings as examples.\n\nX (formerly Twitter) is a good place to search for individuals using popular hashtags from your field or area of study, for example, “#highereducation”\nClick through to their respective X user page. If they have a personal website listed on the user page visit the site and review their “About” page\nVisit their employer’s page and try to locate their biography on the employer’s website\nSearch for the user on LinkedIn\nCompare the user information on these different sites. Observe how they link to social media account, and vary the style and content presented for the different personas\n\nCreate or update your professional profile on LinkedIn.\n\nConsult TWU’s Student Resources website (n.d.-b) which includes information about LinkedIn. TWU gives you access to LinkedIn Learning, which includes several great courses and videos, such as Rock Your LinkedIn Profile (2024).\n\nCreate or update your “About” page on your learning blog. You may prefer using a more informal style for this page aligned with your own personality and interests. Include links to your professional profile and respective links to social media that you use.\nVisit the profile pages of your active social media accounts. Update if necessary, providing links back to your main page (for example, the “About” page on your website).\nThink carefully about information you post publicly and keep a clear distinction between your personal online presence and your professional online persona. Review your privacy settings on your personal account(s).",

    "section": "5.2 Online Communities",
    "text": "5.2 Online Communities\nIn this section we explore the topic of online communities and how we can engage in social media to enhance our learning.\nIn the early years of the internet there was strong research interest in studying the differences between virtual and real communities. However, in more recent years we have observed a blurring of the boundaries between online and real communities. In The Difference Between Online & Real Life Community? Alison Michalk states:\n\nCommunity boundaries are blurred to the extent that the Internet is nothing more than a conduit for communication. The Internet is now just another tool that we use to communicate within our various communities. The same as we use mail, telephone and even a car to keep in touch with our friends, family and colleagues. Our ‘real life communities’ are not mutually exclusive from our ‘online communities’ given that it all comes down to implied physical presence. (2013, para. 2)\n\nSo how do we join and contribute constructively to these digital communities? If you don’t have much experience with online communities, we encourage you to participate in the course forums and become an active member of the TWU online learning community.\n\nResearch on Online Communities\nResearch on the efficacy of online communities provides insights on selecting productive communities and how to engage. Community contributors can be classified into three types (Mocus et al 2002):\n\nCore members are responsible for guiding the development of the community and have usually been involved with the community for a long time. These members have made significant contributions to the community’s evolution and have earned leadership status. Frequently they also play an active role in moderation of the group.\nActive members make regular contributions to the community.\nPeripheral members occasionally contribute to the discussions and the periods of engagement are short and sporadic. “Lurkers”, that is individuals seeking answers without making contributions, are normally associated with this group. The nature of engagement in a community is influenced by the community’s life cycle stage (A. Iriberri and G. Leroy 2009):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife cycle stage\nCharacteristics\n\n\n\n\nInception stage\nFocus is on determining the purpose, codes of conduct, funding and sustainability\n\n\nCreation stage\nUser-centred design and evolution including issues of privacy, anonymity, open versus closed communications\n\n\nGrowth stage\nFocus is on community building, for example, recruiting members, growth management, integrating new members, trust building, up-to-date content, interaction support, a few offline and online events and meetings\n\n\nMaturity stage\nBy this stage a community culture will have emerged with identifiable community leaders. Focus shifts to permeated management and control, recognition of contributions, recognition of loyalty, member satisfaction management and subgroup management.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional factors identified by the research to keep in mind include:\n\nNetwork cohesion, that is the overall level of connections indicated by the network density has a positive impact on the core group as well as the success of the community (Toral et al 2010)\nNetwork structure. Successful communities need a critical mass of contributors, however there is no fixed number that determines success. Most communities can expect between 45–90 % of nonactive members, but communities with a strong and experienced core group will have a positive impact on success (Nonnecke & Preece, 2000, as cited in Toral et al., 2009). Moreover, the positive effects of network structure on participation persist irrespective of the life cycle stage of the community, and activity participation influences network structure (Igl 2014)\nCentralization. Communities with a high degree of centralization and control exert a negative impact on all participation variables (Igl, 2014).\n\n\n\nPractical Implications\nThere are many online communities, and it will be worth your effort in doing a little online research to determine the network cohesion and network structure of the community. You will be able to determine this by reviewing the archive history. Avoid communities with overly centralized control; in the long run, they are not likely to be productive.\nWhen joining an online community try to identify its life cycle stage by scanning the archive of posts. Young communities are likely to be more tolerant of newbie questions, as responses to these questions will provide support resources for new members in the future. It’s a good idea to search the forum for your answer before posting a question. Don’t be surprised if newbie questions go unanswered in mature communities; they may can even attract curt rebuttals. If you’re a longstanding member of the community, post a tactful reply, for example, “Your question has already been answered” and post a link to the appropriate reply.\nThe best advice when joining a new community is to lurk for a while before introducing yourself so that you can become familiar with the culture and practices of the community. Fill out your profile page on the forum site, rather than posting a biography in the main discussion threads. Of course, if the community is in the creation phase, you may want to play a more active role in building the community and becoming part of the core contributors.\n\n\nCommunities of Practice\nAs you continue to reflect on your social network and consider other learning networks to join for personal or professional growth, we want to present another framing of an online community called a community of practice.\n\nA community of practice is a group of people who “share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.” (Wenger-Trayner, 2022)\n\nCognitive anthropologists Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger coined the term community of practice when studying apprenticeships as a learning model—the term referred to the community that acts as a living curriculum. Once the concept was articulated the researchers started to see communities everywhere, even when no formal apprenticeship system existed.\nThe basic premise behind communities of practice is simple: we all learn in everyday life from the communities in which we find ourselves. Communities of practice are everywhere. Nearly everyone belongs to some community of practice, whether it is through our working colleagues or associates, our profession or trade, or our leisure interests, such as a book club.\nWenger-Trayner (2022) argues that a community of practice is different from a community of interest or a geographical community in that it involves a shared practice: ways of doing things that are shared to some significant extent among members.\n\n\nCharacteristics of a Community of Practice\nAccording to Wenger-Treyner (2022) there are three crucial characteristics of a community of practice:\n\nDomain: A common interest that connects and holds together the community;\nCommunity: A community is bound by the shared activities they pursue (for example, meetings, discussions) around their common domain;\nPractice: Members of a community of practice are practitioners; what they do informs their participation in the community; and what they learn from the community affects what they do.Wenger- Treyner has argued that although individuals learn through participation in a community of practice, more important is the generation of newer or deeper levels of knowledge through the sum of the group activity. If the community of practice is centered around business processes, for instance, this can be of considerable benefit to an organization.\n\n\n\nTypes of Communities of Practice\nToday, communities of practices are increasingly being used to improve knowledge management and connect people within business, government, education, and other organizations.\nThe design of the community will look different depending on the purpose and needs of the participants. There are four basic types of communities:\n\nHelping communities provide a forum for community members to help each other with everyday work needs\nBest practice communities develop and disseminate best practices, guidelines, and strategies for their members’ use\nKnowledge stewarding communities organize, manage, and steward a body of knowledge from which community members can draw\nInnovation communities create breakthrough ideas, new knowledge, and new practices\n\nAs you reflect on digital practices in university and the workplace, consider how engaging in a community of practice could benefit you as a learner and in your future career.\n\n\n5.2.1 Activity: What Is a Community of Practice?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Communities of Practice (Etienne and Beverly Wenger-Trayner) (2022)\n\n\n\nTo learn more about the origins and theory of communities of practice, see Introduction to Communities of Practice (2015)\n\nFeel free to discuss your topics of interest in Discourse, or search online for communities of practice that interest you.",

    "text": "5.3 Connecting and Learning Through Social Media\n\n5.3.1 Activity: Mapping My Social Network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline communities are varied and can be categorized by their purpose: social, academic, professional, and so on. For this activity, we encourage you to consider your purpose in building an online community.\nWhat are your goals?\n\nDo you want to connect with TWU peers internationally and in Canada? Is your focus on academic support or building personal relationships? - Are you interested in the communities that relate to your chosen profession? If so, do a quick search for online communities for a career that interests you (e.g., for businesses: 20 Best Online Community Platforms of 2024 (Ranked)).\nDo you want to engage with online communities that align with your personal interests? (e.g., sports, arts, politics, gardening, coding)\nWrite down your goals for joining an online community. Next, consider the networks you are currently a part of. You may want to refer back to Unit 1 in which you created a Personal Learning Network map.\nNow, with a focus on networking create your own Social Map. See the following example from Brian Solis, a digital analyst, anthropologist and author.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Brian Solis Online: Social Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: From “Brian Solis Online,” by B. Solis, March 30, 2008, @BRIANSOLIS (Homepage - Brian Solis). CC BY 2.0.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, reflect on the social media technologies you use for learning and how these impact your digital footprint and online identity.\n\n\n\n\nCollaboration and Annotation Tools\nAnother way to join an online community or discussion forum is to annotate the web. Hypothes.is is one tool used at TWU for students to collaborate and discuss online resources.\nHypothes.is an open source platform that allows users to annotate any website, communicate with others, and collaborate with peers.\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Activity: Introduction To Hypothes.is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the Hypothes.is website and have a quick read to see what the tool is and how it works.\nWatch How to Annotate the Web with hypothes.is (2017) \n\n\nFinally, skim these articles highlighting the benefits of using annotative tools such as Hypothes.is:\n\nSharing Notes Is Encouraged: Annotating and Cocreating with Hypothes.is and Google Docs (2021)\nJottings in the Margins - Using Digital Annotation to Support 21st Century Learning (2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Activity: Annotating and Collaborating in Hypothes.is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity, we will practice using Hypothes.is by annotating an article on the difference between digital skills and digital literacies.\n\nRead the Hypothes.is Quick-Start Guide for Students (2023b) and create an account on Hypothes.is. We recommend that you use the Chrome browser and install the Hypothes.is extension. Alternatively, you can annotate web pages directly from the Hypothes.is website by pasting the link into the text area after you have logged into the site. If you are working on a mobile device, please follow these instructions: How to use Hypothes.is on Mobile Devices (2023a).\nRe-read Nine Themes of Digital Citizenship (2023) and be sure to have your Hypothes.is extension activated so you can see others comments.\nActivate annotations after logging in to Hypothes.is—click the search icon () and enter the course code (LDRS101) to filter posts for this course from the public feed.\nAnnotate or reply to posts by visiting the annotation page (you will need to be logged into the Hypothes.is site to post).\n\nWe encourage you to reply and to “like” posts on Discourse.

Perhaps you have added these resource links to Obsidian or Zotero for future reference (e.g., preparing for citations needed for course assignments).\nHere is one more step we encourage you to take advantage of:\n\nReview the course learning outcomes.\nRefer to the Course Book table of contents and look at the Unit topics, subtopics, and activities listed.\nRecall any resources that stood out to you. What article, video, or website do you want to engage with further? What key points would you like to discuss with your peers?\nSelect three or more resources to reread and annotate using Hypothes.is.\nReply to posts by visiting the annotation page (you will need to be logged into the Hypothes.is site to post).\n\nWe encourage you to reply and to “like” posts on Discourse. Remember to tag your posts using key words to facilitate searches (e.g. digital-rights).\n\n\n\n\n5.3.5 Activity: Social Media for Connecting and Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity we will explore how social media can support online learning and engagement.\n\nRead Social Media for Learning (n.d.)\nWatch Building More Creative Social Networks (2020)\n\n\n\nCheck out The Conversation Prism (2008) and also refer to the graphic below listing numerous apps for listening, learning, and adapting (click the graphic to enlarge).\n\nFeel free to annotate the articles you read or reply to annotations using Hypothes.is.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: The Conversation Prism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: From “Conversations Prism 4” by SolucionaFacil.es, December 12, 2013, Flickr.

Choose one or more of the following questions as a catalyst for your contributions to the forum:\n\nHow much of what you learn should be open and transparent (i.e., public) and how much should be kept private? Why?\nIn a digital age, how important is it for you to build a digital footprint of your learning?\nWhat are the challenges and opportunities for building your online identity?\nWhat levels of online engagement do you feel are appropriate for your own learning on this course? Does this differ from your engagement in other online communities?\nOther?\n\n\nWe encourage you to reply and to “like” posts on Discourse.

Explores how learners are situated in “the digital” throughout their lives and how they can use digital technologies to enhance and enrich their experience of learning, working, and playing. Learners will begin to build a curated digital footprint, initiate and develop personal and professional learning networks; develop competencies to allow them to evaluate and choose digital platforms and tools that are safe and ethical; and explore how to use digital technologies to discover, curate, connect, and share knowledge with their communities.\nNext, focus on two key course learning outcomes:\n\nDevelop personal and professional learning networks to discover and share knowledge, collaborate with others, and become engaged digital global citizens.\nCreate inclusive digital communities which embody a sense of belonging, connection, and Christian hospitality.\n\nFinally, take a look at Trinity’s Life at TWU (n.d.-a) website.\nWe invite all TWU students to connect, thrive, and serve in a dynamic, Christ-centred learning community where they can develop as maturing disciples, thoughtful global citizens, and compassionate servant leaders.

    "text": "6.1 Sharing Your Learning at TWU\nCommunity is an essential component of Trinity Western University. Just have a look at the TWU website and you will find several references to learning within a community. For example:\n\nAt Trinity Western University, you’ll experience an authentic and engaging community as you enrich your understanding of the world—preparing for a life of faithful engagement in your community and profession. We are deeply committed to providing a transformational education, where you will develop practical professional skills while exploring bigger ideas about who you are, what you believe, and what you’re called to do in the world. (Trinity Western University, n.d.-c)\n\nWhy is community so important to TWU, and how does it help us learn? Have a quick read about TWU’s Core Values (n.d.-b). At this point in the course, we hope you have taken full advantage of the online community and have personal examples of how these interactions have impacted you.\nAs for learning … how does sharing our learning within a community help us achieve our personal and professional goals?\nThere are several social learning theories and practices that explain how social interactions impact our learning (e.g., situated learning, social constructivism, connectivism, cooperative and collaborative learning, communities of inquiry, and so on). If you’re interested, feel free to look these up online or use tools such as LitMaps to explore the research on these theories.\nIn this course we have promoted the use of tools that allow you to share your learning online: Discourse, Hypothes.is, and WordPress. Our goal is to help you utilize technology to discover and share knowledge, collaborate with others, and become engaged digital global citizens. In the next activity, we ask you to reflect on your learning experiences and your goals.\n\n6.1.1 Activity: Learning in Community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources that explain how we learn in community.\n\nSocial Learning in Online Environments (n.d.)\nSocial Learning Theories (2021)\nSocial Networking, Knowledge Sharing, and Student Learning: The Case of University Students (2016)\nCollaborative Learning in Higher Education: Evoking Positive Interdependence (2016)\n\nWatch What is Social Learning? (2017)\n\n\nAt TWU you may be asked to participate in various group activities, such as group work, partner projects, team presentations, and so on. Have a look at this resource that explains examples and reasons for these activities: - Group Work: Using Cooperative Learning Groups Effectively (2015)\nStudents also have the opportunity to share their learning beyond the classroom. Here are some examples highlighting student collaboration and sharing at TWU:\n\nTWU Media + Communications Students Showcase Their Work at Student Film Festival, Cinergy 2023 (2023)\nStudents Attend the Western Division of Canadian Association of Geographers (2017)\n\nConsider the following questions:\n\nHow have you experienced social learning in your educational experiences?\nHow did it help or hinder your learning?\nWhat are your goals for sharing your learning at TWU and beyond? Share your thoughts by posting a comment on Discourse, for example: “Sharing learning in academia is valuable because …”\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Activity: Preparing for the Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTWU has a Centre for Calling & Career Development that aims to equip students for their future careers. Have a look at their Career Ready Framework in the figure below.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Career Ready Framework\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: From “Centre for Calling & Career Development,” by Trinity Western University. (n.d.)\nWhat competencies do you see that relate to social learning and digital skills? As this course aims to prepare you for the technology skills that are needed in this digital age, we also want to encourage you to develop personal and professional learning networks to discover and share knowledge, collaborate with others, and become engaged digital global citizens.\nConsider the following questions:\n\nWhat skills and competencies do you want to practice to be successful in your future career?\nHow does collaborative learning and sharing your learning contribute to your learning journey?\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts in your Obsidian journal, Discourse, or your WordPress blog.",

    "section": "6.2 Digital Practices in the Workplace",
    "text": "6.2 Digital Practices in the Workplace\nIn this topic we consider how changes in technology have and will continue to impact digital practices in the workplace. Pause and consider the following questions:\n\nHow do professionals in your field of interest network online?\nHow has technology changed business practices in your field of interest or career?\nWhat are the implications for learning and skills development in your future career precipitated by changes in digital technology?\n\n\n6.2.1 Activity: The Future of Work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following short video, Ken Steele from Eduvation speculates about the future of the labour market and the value of higher education in a digital age.\n\nWatch Higher Ed Trends: Student Career Anxiety and the Future of Work (2015)\n\n\nWhat do you think? Share your thoughts by posting a comment on Discourse, for example:\n\nHigher education is valuable because …\nIn a digital age …\nI am confident that …\nI am concerned about …\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology and Change\nThroughout history there are technologies that have influenced change in society. Consider, for example, the invention of the steam engine and its contribution to the Industrial Revolution. In more recent times, the advent of digital photography displaced Kodachrome (at one time, the market leader in colour film sales) which ceased production in 2009.\n\n\n6.2.2 Activity: Newspaper and Music Industry in a Digital Age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe readings that follow take a retrospective look at the impact of the internet on the newspaper and music industries.\n\nThe age of Digital; Music Executive Reacts to the Impact of Digitalization in the Music Industry (2022)\nThe Future of Newspapers in the Digital Age: Embracing the Change! (2023) Add or reply to annotations using Hypothes.is, sharing personal insights and experiences. Remember to tag your posts using the course code: LDRS101.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Activity: Impact of Digital Technology on Business\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity we invite you to join the Discourse discussion on the impact of digital technology on business.\n\nFirst, choose any business or work environment (for example, your current career or future career).\nThink about examples of how digital technology has had an impact on your chosen business over the last 30 years.\nState your business or work environment and share a practical example of how digital technology has influenced change in your chosen area:\nHas the example contributed to a fundamental change in the way things were done, or is this a minor change?\nDo you anticipate significant changes in your industry as a result of digital technology in the future? Provide an example.\n\nLike, share, and reply to posts. These are forms of engagement and a contribution to your online learning identity.\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is already transforming society and business, from self-driving cars to voice-activated assistants and advanced machine learning systems. For example, commercially available chess programs can now defeat skilled players, including grandmasters, showcasing the impressive capability of AI-driven systems.\nIn this section, we’ll explore a few compelling examples of AI to give you a sense of how these technologies are evolving and shaping the world around us.\nFirst, let’s define AI:\n\nThe theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. (Oxford Reference, n.d.)\n\n\nThe capacity of a computer, robot, programmed device, or software application to perform operations and tasks analogous to learning and decision making in humans, such as speech recognition or question answering. (Dictionary.com, 2024)\n\nWhat is your experience with AI? Have you used AI tools such as Grammerly or ChatGPT? How has this technology affected you as a student, and what impact does it have on your chosen profession?\nIn the next activity, we’ll explore some of these questions and concerns.\n\n\n6.2.4 Activity: How Can I Use AI as a Student?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, do a quick search online for AI tools for university students. Examples:\n\nHow can AI be Used by University Students? (2023)\n10 Best AI Tools for Homework and Studying in 2024 (2023)\n\nIntrigued? Do you find any tech tools that would be useful in understanding course topics, studying, generating flashcards, transcribing lectures and voice notes, correcting grammar, writing an essay, creating a slideshow presentation, drafting a forum discussion post, and so on?\nDo any of these capabilities concern you? Do you think they concern your professors or fellow students?\nReview TWU’s policy on Academic Misconduct & Fraud (n.d.-a). Is it academic fraud if you use Chat GPT to complete assignments?\nSearch online for key words related to this issue, such as “university concern policy artificial intelligence” and you will find numerous articles on the use of AI in universities, as well as emerging policies. The University of Toronto’s guidelines and FAQ for ChatGPT and Generative AI in the Classroom (2024) are one such example.\nHere are some guidelines you may receive from your instructors at TWU:\n\nStudents are encouraged to make use of technology including generative artificial intelligence tools to contribute to their understanding of course materials. Students must submit as an appendix with their assignments any content produced by an artificial intelligence tool, and the prompt used to generate the content.\nAny content produced by an artificial intelligence tool must be cited appropriately. Many organizations that publish standard citation formats now provide information on citing generative AI (e.g., MLA Style Center).\nStudents may use artificial intelligence tools for creating an outline for an assignment but the final submitted assignment must be original work produced by the individual student alone.\nStudents may not use artificial intelligence tools for taking tests, writing research papers, creating computer code, or completing major course assignments. However, these tools may be useful when gathering information across sources and assimilating it for understanding.\n\nIf you have any question about the use of AI applications for course work, please speak with your instructor.\n\nWatch How AI Could Save (Not Destroy) Education (2023)\n\n\nHere is one more article that discusses the pros and cons of English learners using AI in their studies:\n\nPerspectives of the Use of ChatGPT as a Tool for Online Education of English (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.5 Activity: How to Identify AI Generated Text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the infographic below by Ryan Morrison. Tip: You may want to view the resource full screen (Click on the three dots on the bottom right, and then select the full screen arrows.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider trying out ChatGPT to see if you can spot the ways to identify AI generated writing.\n\nWatch Plagiarizing ChatGPT - Is it Illegal? (2022)\n\n\n\nOptional resource: ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education: Quick Start Guide. (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs and Automation\nIn this section we consider the impact of automation on the future job market and the implications for education and training. Consider:\n\nWill robots replace humans?\nWhat jobs are most at risk of being replaced by robots?\nWhat are the implications for learning in a digital age?\n\n\n\n6.2.6 Activity: Impact of Automation and AI in the Workplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Collaborative Intelligence: Humans and AI are Joining Forces (2018).\nWatch AI Automation And The Future Of The Workforce (2022)\n\n\nConsider your chosen field of study. How can AI benefit your industry? Are there any concerns regarding how AI might be used?\n\n\n\n\n6.2.7 Activity: The Price of AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this topic we’ve explored AI—its possibilities for study and careers, and some concerns about using AI. This activity focuses on how AI moderates harmful content. How does AI know what is harmful? Since AI tools are built on all kinds of information, including harmful and hateful content, how is this content identified?\nAI systems require lots of work from humans to function correctly. A 2023 report from Time magazine showed that people in Kenya were paid poverty wages to build a safety system into ChatGPT (Perrigo, 2023). Since the platform was fed data from various places sometimes it would make racist or abusive remarks. To build a safeguard into the system, workers were exposed to vile and offensive web content in order to tag it so that the platform could eventually recognize offensive speech on its own. A large portion of this content was very traumatic, and workers interviewed said they were mentally scarred from the work.\n\nRead OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour to Make ChatGPT Less Toxic (2023) and Inside Facebook’s African Sweatshop (2022)\nWatch Doing Grueling Work for an AI: Data Labeling (2023)\n\n\nQuestions to Consider:\n\nIs it ethical to submit Kenyan workers to trauma in order to sanitize ChatGPT for other users?\nWhat other solutions are there for training AI to moderate content?\n\nShare your thoughts on AI by posting a comment on Discourse, for example:\n\nAI will …\nI was surprised that AI …\nIn [insert business] AI will …",

    "section": "6.3 Societal Issues and the Internet",
    "text": "6.3 Societal Issues and the Internet\nIn this next topic we introduce a number of societal issues and problematic online behaviours that have emerged in the digital world. Our list is not comprehensive and does not provide a thorough examination of the issues. Here, we encourage you to choose one of the following issues for further investigation.\n\nWebsite tracking\nOnline impersonation\nInternet trolling\nOnline harassment\nPsychological issues\nNet neutrality\nDigital redlining \n\nChoose one societal issue or antisocial behaviour associated with the internet that you would like to investigate further. You may wish to browse the other sections, but each topic can be time-consuming, so be sure to map out your time so you can complete your learning goals. Your task will be to publish an editorial on your chosen topic in your course blog. You will base your focus on your reading of open access resources you find online. Your blog post will also help you build your online identity.\n\n6.3.1 Activity: Problematic Online Behaviours—Key Terms Quiz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo test your knowledge of concepts associated with problematic behaviours online, we provide a short orientation quiz below. Once you have attempted your first answer, and in the event that you are not familiar or not sure what the alternatives mean, click the options to find out more about the concept.\nHow did you do? Have you encountered any of these behaviours online? Share your thoughts by posting a comment on Discourse.\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Tracking\nWebsite tracking is the practice of collecting data about a user’s online activities when they visit websites or use web services. This data is gathered primarily for marketing and analytical purposes, allowing website owners, advertisers, and service providers to better understand user behaviour, tailor their services, and deliver targeted content and advertisements.\n\n\n6.3.2 Activity: The True Cost of Free Websites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch this Matrix parody, a comedy skit published by CollegeHumour, depicting that if you are not paying for the service, you are not the consumer but the product.\n\nWatch The Terrifying Cost of “Free” Websites (2016)\n\n\n\n\nWere you surprised by any ideas presented in the video? Do you think this is a valid and reliable source for the topic?\nNext we will give an overview of how website tracking works, how your data is used, and how you can protect yourself online.\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        How does website tracking work? Click/tap this banner to show/hide the content.\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Cookies: Cookies are small text files that websites\nstore on your device. They contain information about your online\nactivities such as login credentials, preferences, and browsing history.\nWebsites use cookies to recognize and remember you when you return, and\nthey can also track your movements across the site.\nIP Address Tracking: Every device connected to the\ninternet has a unique IP address. Websites can log and analyze these\naddresses to determine a user’s approximate location and to track their\nvisits.\nAnalytics Tools: Many websites use analytics tools\nsuch as Google Analytics to monitor user behaviour. These tools track\nwhich pages you visit, how long you stay on each page, and how you\narrived at the website (e.g., through a search engine or a referral from\nanother site). This data helps website owners optimize their content and\nuser experience.\nAd Trackers: Advertisers and ad networks use various\ntechniques to track your online behaviour. They place cookies on your\ndevice, which allows them to follow your movements across multiple\nwebsites. This data is used to deliver personalized ads based on your\ninterests and browsing history.\nSocial Media Widgets: Social media buttons and\nwidgets on websites can track your activity, even if you don’t click\nthem. They often use this information to build a profile of your\ninterests and habits.\nFingerprinting: Fingerprinting is a technique that\ncollects data about your device and browser configuration such as your\nscreen resolution, installed fonts, and plugins. This information can be\nused to create a unique identifier for your device and track your online\nactivities.\nLocation Data: Many websites request access to your\ndevice’s location information. This can be used to provide\nlocation-based services, but it also allows websites to track your\nphysical movements.\nData Brokers: Your data may be collected,\naggregated, and sold to data brokers who build detailed profiles about\nindividuals. These profiles can include your demographic information,\ninterests, and online behaviour.\n      \n    \n  \n      \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        How is my data used when I use the Internet? Click/tap this banner to show/hide the content.\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Personalization: Websites and online services use\nthe data they collect to personalize your experience; for example, they\nmay recommend products, content, or services based on your browsing\nhistory and preferences.\nTargeted Advertising: Advertisers use your data to\nshow you ads that are more likely to be relevant to your interests. This\nis why you might see ads for products you’ve recently searched for\nonline.\nAnalytics and Optimization: Website owners use\ntracking data to improve their websites and services, making them more\nuser friendly and effective.\nMarket Research: Aggregated user data is often used\nfor market research and to identify trends and consumer preferences.\nData Profiling: Your data may be used to build\ndetailed profiles about you. These profiles can be used for a variety of\npurposes including credit scoring, job recruiting, and targeted\nmarketing.\nSecurity and Fraud Prevention: Tracking data can\nalso be used for security purposes, helping to detect and prevent\nfraudulent activities.\n      \n    \n  \n      \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        What are the privacy concerns? Click/tap this banner to show/hide the content.\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Privacy concerns regarding website tracking primarily revolve around\nthe collection and use of personal data without the explicit consent of\nusers. Here are some key privacy concerns and ways in which users can\nprotect themselves from tracking:\nInvasion of Privacy: Website tracking can create a\ndetailed profile of an individual’s online behaviour, which may include\nsensitive information such as health concerns, financial status, or\npersonal interests. This can be seen as an invasion of privacy.\nData Breaches: There is an increased risk of data\nbreaches when your data is collected and stored by multiple parties. If\na hacker gains access to a company’s database that stores user data,\nyour personal information may be exposed.\nTargeted Advertising: While some users appreciate\npersonalized ads, others find them intrusive and a form of manipulation.\nThe extensive tracking of online behaviour allows advertisers to deliver\nhighly targeted ads, which can feel invasive.\nThird-Party Sharing: Data collected by websites is\noften shared with third-party companies, including data brokers and ad\nnetworks. Users may not be aware of who has access to their data and how\nit’s used.\n      \n    \n  \n      \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        How can I protect myself from tracking? Click/tap this banner to show/hide the content.\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Use Privacy-Focused Browsers: Consider using web\nbrowsers that prioritize user privacy, such as Mozilla Firefox or the\nTor Browser. These browsers often include built in tracking protection\nfeatures.\nBrowser Extensions: Install browser extensions or\nadd-ons such as uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, and HTTPS Everywhere,\nwhich can block tracking cookies, scripts, and enhance your online\nsecurity.\nOpt-Out Options: Some websites and advertising\nnetworks provide options to opt out of personalized ads. You can often\nfind these settings in the privacy sections of websites or through\nindustry specific opt-out platforms such as the Network Advertising\nInitiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).\nUse a VPN: A virtual private network (VPN) can hide\nyour IP address and encrypt your internet traffic, making it more\nchallenging for websites to track your location and online\nactivities.\nCookie Settings: Adjust your browser’s cookie\nsettings to block third-party cookies. You can choose to accept cookies\nonly from visited websites, which limits tracking across different\nsites.\nUse Private Browsing Modes: Most browsers offer\nprivate or incognito modes that don’t store your browsing history or\ncookies. While this doesn’t provide complete anonymity, it limits\ntracking to a single session.\nSearch Engines: Consider using privacy focused\nsearch engines such as DuckDuckGo or Startpage, which do not track your\nsearch queries.\nReview App Permissions: On mobile devices, review\nand restrict the permissions granted to apps, including location access.\nSome apps collect more data than necessary for their core\nfunctionality.\nRegularly Clear Cookies: Periodically clear your\nbrowser’s cookies and browsing history to remove tracking data that has\nbeen collected over time.\nEducate Yourself: Stay informed about online privacy\nand data protection practices. Understand the privacy policies of\nwebsites and services you use and be cautious about sharing personal\ninformation online.\nConsider VPNs and Encrypted Messaging: For\nheightened privacy, use end-to-end encrypted messaging apps such as\nSignal, and consider using a reputable VPN service to protect your\nonline communication.\nIt’s important to note that while these steps can help reduce online\ntracking they might not completely eliminate it. Achieving complete\nanonymity on the internet is challenging, but these measures can\nsignificantly enhance your online privacy and data security.\nAdditionally, privacy laws and regulations in your region may provide\nyou with rights and options for controlling how your data is collected\nand used online.\n      \n    \n  \n      \n\n\n6.3.3 Activity: Website Tracking Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose from the resources below to inform your views on website and data tracking: - The Real Cost of the ‘Free’ Internet (2018) - Don’t Be Evil: Should we use Google in Schools? (2021)\nAlso review these resources on corporate sponsored research:\n\nFunding Bias (2024)\nSponsors’ Participation in Conduct and Reporting of Industry Trials: A Descriptive Study (2012)\nAd Blocking (2024)\n\nAfter viewing these resources, what do you think the cost of free websites is? Do you use ad blocking software? Think about the reasons for your choice.\nShare your thoughts on Discourse or use Hypothes.is to annotate and share your comments.\n\n\n\n\nOnline Impersonation\nImpersonation online refers to the act of creating an online presence in someone else’s name. This is potentially a complex issue as some social media sites permit parody accounts or accounts that are intended to represent real individuals. It is not necessarily illegal to impersonate someone per se, for example in comedy, but online impersonation is a growing problem. Many social media sites have anti-impersonation policies, but this is not sufficient guarantee or protection against the risks of online impersonation.\n\n\n\n6.3.4 Activity: Identify the Imposter!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit the profile page of following X (formerly Twitter) accounts:\n\nNelson Mandela\nMark Zuckerburg\nElon Musk\nDarth Vader\n\n\nClearly these social media accounts are not the “real” people. In one case it’s a foundation promoting the legacy of Nelson Mandela, the next two examples are parody accounts of two tech giants, and the last example is, well, Darth Vader!\n\nRead the following articles on the social media response to impersonation:\n\nMisleading and Deceptive Identities Policy (X) (2023)\nHow to Report a Facebook Account or Page That’s Pretending to be me or Someone Else?

What clues did you have that it was not real?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If interested, search on X for some parody accounts. Some can be quite entertaining, but you might notice that other accounts simply mock the person they are parodying. Would you create a parody account in order to ridicule someone—perhaps a political view you don’t agree with? What should our response be to such messages on social media?

But not everyone living under a bridge is a troll. (Wikimedia Foundations, n.d.)\n\nIt is estimated that that the internet has about 5.35 billion users, almost half the population of the world (Tsvetkova, 2023). With the growing number of internet and social media users we are witnessing an increase in antisocial behaviour online.\nIn this section we explore the phenomenon of internet trolling and strategies for managing disruptive online behaviour, taking the communication context into account.\n\nIn slang, a troll is a person who posts deliberately offensive or provocative messages online (such as in social media, a newsgroup, a forum, a chat room, an online video game) or who performs similar behaviors in real life. The methods and motivations of trolls can range from benign to sadistic. These messages can be inflammatory, insincere, digressive, extraneous, or off-topic, and may have the intent of provoking others into displaying emotional responses, or manipulating others’ perception, thus acting as a bully or a provocateur. The behavior is typically for the troll’s amusement, or to achieve a specific result such as disrupting a rival’s online activities or purposefully causing confusion or harm to others. (“Troll (Slang),” 2024)\n\n\n\n6.3.7 Activity: Trolling in Social Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake the Spot the Troll quiz (n.d.), which uses images of real social media content. How did you do?

Notwithstanding the seriousness of these offences, antisocial behaviours associated with other forms of online harassment are more pervasive than most people realize.\nIn this section, we will review research on the state of online harassment and consider how leading social media sites attempt to manage the challenge.\n\n\n6.3.8 Activity: The State of Online Harassment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the following research reports on online harassment. - Online Harassment (2017). (Note that this is an 8-page report; click through to read it all.) - Q&A: What We’ve Learned About Online Harassment (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote in particular the finding that those “who have ever experienced more severe forms of harassment – such as physical threats, stalking, sexual harassment or sustained harassment – or multiple forms of harassing behaviors online have both risen substantially in the past three years. This is not the pattern we saw in prior surveys. There has been a markedly steeper rise in these measures since 2017, compared with the change between our 2014 and 2017 studies” (DeSilver, 2021).\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider: - What surprised you when reading these reports? - Why have the forms of harassment become more severe? - Have you or someone you know experienced some kind of online harassment?\nAdd or reply to annotations using Hypothes.is to share personal insights and experiences.

The future is still so much bigger than the past. (Tim Berners-Lee, 2009, as cited in Medium, 2023)\n\nThe World Wide Web was originally designed to provide universal access to a large universe of documents. To achieve universal access it was paramount to design the web as an open system without a central locus of control. However, on the internet there are an increasing number of “walled gardens” that aim to control user’s access to content and services. In this section we explore the concept of net neutrality and reflect on the risks associated with universal access to online information.\nNet neutrality is a critical concept in the realm of internet policy and regulation. It revolves around the principle that internet service providers (ISPs) should treat all data on the internet equally. In other words, they should not discriminate against, or charge differently based on user, content, website, application, or platform. The primary goal of net neutrality is to ensure that the internet remains an open and level playing field where all data and information can be accessed and transmitted freely.\n\nArguments For Net Neutrality\n\nPreservation of open internet: Net neutrality proponents argue that it is essential to maintain the open nature of the internet, where all content is equally accessible to users. This fosters innovation, competition, and free expression.\nEqual access: Net neutrality ensures that users, regardless of their economic status, can access all online content without discrimination. It prevents ISPs from creating fast lanes for certain content, disadvantaging others.\nInnovation: Without net neutrality, ISPs could prioritize certain services or websites, potentially stifling innovation by making it difficult for new, smaller players to compete on a level playing field.\n\n\n\nArguments Against Net Neutrality\n\nInvestment and infrastructure: Opponents argue that without the ability to offer paid prioritization or tiered services, ISPs may have less incentive to invest in and improve network infrastructure, potentially hindering the growth of broadband services.\nRegulatory overreach: Some argue that government intervention in net neutrality is unnecessary, and that market forces should determine how ISPs manage their networks. They fear that regulation could lead to unintended consequences such as the government controlling access to online content.\nQuality of service: In certain cases, ISPs claim they need the flexibility to manage network traffic to provide a better quality of service for applications such as real-time video and gaming.\n\n\n\nKey Concerns\nConcerns surrounding net neutrality involve potential discrimination, a lack of competition, and the profound implications for free speech and innovation. The absence of robust net neutrality principles could pave the way for ISPs to exert unwarranted control. They might throttle or obstruct access to specific websites, promote their own content, or levy extra charges for particular online services.\nAt the same time there is a significant concern about government overreach in this digital domain. The debate over how much the government should regulate the internet is a hot topic, as it could hamper innovation and limit the free sharing of information. Excessive regulation could put the power to control or tamper with online content in the hands of the government or regulators, potentially jeopardizing our democratic values and our basic freedom of expression. Navigating this tricky balance between rules and protecting our personal freedoms is a key challenge in the digital era.\n\n\nCanadian Context\nIn Canada, the discussion on net neutrality is intertwined with the debate over Bill C-10, also known as the Broadcasting Act. This bill, introduced in 2021, aims to update Canada’s broadcasting and telecommunications regulations to account for the digital age. Critics of Bill C-10 have expressed concerns that it could infringe on net neutrality principles by giving more power to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to regulate online content, potentially leading to restrictions on free expression and innovation.\nIn addition to Bill C-10, another significant piece of legislation to consider in the Canadian context is Bill C-18, which is also known as the Online Streaming Act. This bill, introduced to the Canadian Parliament, is designed to regulate online streaming services, potentially affecting the content and accessibility of such platforms. Critics argue that Bill C-18 could raise concerns related to net neutrality by granting the government more authority over the content available on streaming platforms and potentially infringing on free expression and access to diverse content.\nQuestions to Consider\nAs you view the resources in the activity below, consider the following questions:\n\nHow does the principle of net neutrality impact the way you access and use the internet, and how might changes in net neutrality regulations affect your online experience?\nWhat is the role of government and regulatory bodies, such as the CRTC in Canada, in ensuring a balance between net neutrality and the need to regulate online content and services?\nWhat measures can be taken to ensure that government regulations, while addressing valid concerns, do not lead to the overreach of power and the erosion of fundamental rights such as free speech on the internet?\nCan net neutrality coexist with the goal of ensuring high quality internet service and fostering investment in digital infrastructure, or are these objectives inherently in conflict?\n\nConsider drawing a mind map such as the following to track your understanding of the subject.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Net Neutrality and Creative Freedom Mind Map Illustration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: From “Net Neutrality and Creative Freedom: Tim Wu at re:publica 2010,” by A.

Here are some sample resources, but please search for additional resources that interest you. Seek out different perspectives on the topic to inform your views. - First, have a look at a summary of Net Neutrality by Country (2024).\nNext, click the topics below to explore different perspectives on this issue in Canada.\n\nStrengthening Net Neutrality in Canada (2016)\nBig Tech vs. Canadian News: The Battle Over C-18, Explained (2023)\nBill C-18: The Fallout over Google, Meta’s Plans to Block News Links in Canada (2023)\nDebating Bill C-11—Internet Censorship for Canadians (2023)\nPoilievre: Warned About Justin Trudeau’s Online Censorship Law (2023)\n\nDr. Michael Geist is a law professor at the University of Ottawa where he holds the Canada Research Chair in Internet and e-Commerce Law and is a member of the Centre for Law, Technology and Society. Browse through his articles on net neutrality.\nHere are some key points of interest from Dr. Geist:\n\nFirst, while the focus of net neutrality is typically on telecom companies, Bill C-10 envisions a different intermediary or third party – the Canadian government via the CRTC – choosing which content Canadians see by prioritizing or de-prioritizing content that appears in Canadians’ feeds. Internet sites and services will still be available to Canadians (assuming the sites aren’t blocked given the onerous regulations), but the government’s Internet regulatory framework will mean that Internet content will not be treated in a neutral, equal fashion. The mandated Canadian content discoverability requirements will mean that a government regulator will influence what Canadians see when they access Internet services, invoking the same concerns regarding interfering with content and user choice. The intermediary may have changed, but the principle is largely the same. (Geist, 2021, para. 9)\n\n\nIt is hard to overstate how dangerous it would be for the CRTC to be vested with new powers to regularly intervene in online content or consider “conditions of service” for Internet sites and services. While the government insists that Bill C-11 is designed for large streaming services with limited regulations, it would appear that the CRTC may have other ideas. (Geist, 2022, final para.)\n\n\nIt is difficult to separate the government’s willingness to censor social media posts with its broader Internet regulation agenda, including Bills C-11, C-18 and online harms. Seeking to remove news links, mean tweets and other content without due process and without any apparent illegality does not bode well for the development of Charter-compliant regulations. The government may see itself as a model for others, but its willingness to muscle social media companies in an effort to remove lawful content is the very worst kind of example that should not be welcome in a democracy that prioritizes freedom of expression. (Geist, 2023, final para.)\n\nAnother interesting perspective on the issue comes from Digital First Canada a nonprofit organization that advocates on behalf of digital entrepreneurs in Canada. If you are choosing to focus on net neutrality for your blog post, browse the articles on their website.\nHere are a couple more resources focusing on the American debate on net neutrality.\n\nRead the following on net neutrality in America:\n\nNet Neutrality is BACK!

AT&T and 120 Years After the Act to Regulate Commerce (2007)\n\nFacebook and Big Tech: Facebook Zero: An Attempt to Bring Access to All? Consider the following from Wikipedia (2024, Introduction):\n\nFacebook Zero is an initiative undertaken by social networking service company Facebook in collaboration with mobile phone-based Internet providers, whereby the providers waive data (bandwidth) charges (also known as zero-rate) for accessing Facebook on phones via a stripped-down text-only version of its mobile website (as opposed to the ordinary mobile website m.facebook.com that also loads pictures). The stripped-down version is available online only through providers who have entered the agreement with Facebook.\n…and then some criticism:\n\nFacebook Zero became controversial in some countries due to several issues such as net neutrality. For instance, India’s Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) bans zero-rated services on account of “discriminatory tariffs for data services on the basis of content”. A criticism also stated that Facebook is practicing digital colonialism because it is not introducing open internet but building a “little web that turns the user into a mostly passive consumer of mostly western corporate content”(“Facebook Zero,” 2024, History section).\n\n\nChoose from the following:\n\nWho Really Wins From Facebook’s ‘Free Internet’ Plan for Africa? (2015)\nEuropean Regulators Just Stopped Facebook, Google and Big Telecoms’ Net Neutrality Violations (2022)\nInternet.org (2024)\nIndia Bans Facebook’s Basics app to Support Net Neutrality (2016)\nFacebook’s Internet.org Isn’t Going Over Well in India (2016)\n\nShare your thoughts on net neutrality by posting a comment on Discourse. For example:\n\nNet neutrality is important because …\nNet neutrality can/can’t coexist with Internet.org because …\nFree basics is a good thing because …\nFree basics is problematic because …\n\n\nRemember to add a category or tag for your post using the course tag: LDRS101.\n\n\n\nDigital Redlining\nDigital redlining refers to the discriminatory practice of denying or limiting access to certain services, information, or opportunities in the digital world, based on a person’s location, economic status, race, or other demographic factors. It is an extension of the historical concept of redlining, which originally referred to the discriminatory practice of marking certain neighborhoods on physical maps and denying residents of those areas access to financial services, insurance, and other resources.\nIn the context of the digital age, digital redlining manifests in various ways:\nLimited internet access: Some areas, often low income neighborhoods or rural regions, may lack access to high speed internet or affordable data plans. This limits people’s ability to access online education, job opportunities, government services, and other online resources.\nDiscriminatory algorithms: Algorithms used in various online services such as lending, housing, and employment platforms may inadvertently or intentionally discriminate against certain groups. For example, an algorithm may give preferential treatment to job applicants from specific demographics.\nTargeted advertising and privacy concerns: Certain demographics may be disproportionately exposed to predatory or harmful online advertisements, while more privileged individuals receive personalized, less invasive content. This can lead to manipulation and exploitation.\nEducational disparities: Inadequate access to technology and online educational resources can limit learning opportunities for students in underserved communities.\nHealthcare access: Some communities may have limited access to telehealth services, which have become increasingly important, especially, for example, during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nData collection and surveillance: Vulnerable populations are often subject to more extensive data collection and surveillance, leading to privacy concerns and potential discrimination based on the data collected.\nAddressing digital redlining is essential to ensure equitable access to the benefits of the digital age. Efforts to combat digital redlining include policies aimed at closing the digital divide, regulating algorithms to prevent discriminatory outcomes, promoting net neutrality, and protecting data privacy. These measures aim to create a more inclusive and fair digital environment for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, race, or location.\n\n\n\n6.3.13 Activity: Indigenous Communities in Canada\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital redlining is a global concern, including Canada. While Canada is known for its social safety nets and relatively high internet penetration rates, digital disparities persist, particularly among marginalized communities. These disparities are evident in various aspects, such as internet access, online discrimination, and algorithmic biases.\n\nWatch Seneca Nation disconnected by Redlining (2021)\n\n\nThis report highlights the digital disparities faced by Indigenous communities in Canada. Many Indigenous communities, especially those in remote areas, lack reliable high speed internet access, which hampers their ability to participate fully in the digital world. This limitation affects various aspects of life, including education, health care, economic opportunities, and cultural preservation.\nAddressing these issues in Canada requires a multifaceted approach, combining infrastructure development, antidiscrimination regulations, and community engagement. Initiatives such as the Connecting Families Initiative and investments in broadband infrastructure are steps in the right direction but more work is needed to ensure equitable access to the digital world for all Canadians. This includes recognizing the unique challenges faced by Indigenous communities and implementing policies that specifically address their needs while promoting digital inclusion and addressing digital redlining for all marginalized groups.\n\n\n\n\n6.3.14 Activity: Where Do You See Digital Redlining?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you explore this topic, consider where digital redlining occurs in your community. Search online, or perhaps ask community members about their experiences in accessing the internet. Is digital access fair and accessible for all?\nIn addition to your personal research, select from the following resources for more information on digital redlining.\n\nListen to the podcast: Digital Redlining and Privacy (2016) with Chris Gilliard. Gilliard is a Professor of English whose scholarship concentrates on privacy, institutional technology policy, digital redlining, and the reinventions of discriminatory practices through data mining and algorithmic decision making, especially as these apply to college students.\nChoose from the following resources to explore:\n\nBad Algorithms are Making Racist Decisions (2018b)\nWhat Is Digital Redlining? Experts Explain the Nuances (2022)\nWhat is Digital Redlining and how Does it Perpetuate Poverty? (2023)\n\n\nAlso see the following articles that focus on racial and gender bias:\n\nGoogle Search: Hyper-visibility as a Means of Rendering Black Women and Girls Invisible (2013)\nPedagogy and the Logic of Platforms (2017)\nDigital Redlining, Access, and Privacy (2016)\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve explored a number of societal issues associated with the internet. In the activity below, you will choose a topic of interest relating to societal issues or problematic behaviours on the internet for further investigation. You can select one of the topics introduced in this unit or an alternate issue you find more interesting.\nHere are few additional topics to consider:\n\n10 Forms of Online Harassment (2015)\nCyberchondria (2017)\nThe Woman Whose Phone ‘Misdiagnosed HIV’ (2017) (complexities of mobile ownership in the developing world)\nFace-off Between MPs and Social Media Giants Over Online Hate Speech (2017) (hate speech online)\nKeystroke Logging (2024)\nThe Price of Connection: Surveillance Capitalism (2016) (surveillance capitalism)\nHow Bots Took Over Twitter (2015) (bot problems)\nScams and how to Avoid Them (n.d.)\nFake News (2024)\n\n\n\n6.3.15 Activity: Editorial: Societal Issues on the Internet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublish an editorial (400–600 words) on your blog on a societal issue or antisocial behaviour associated with the internet.

At this point in the course, we hope you have taken full advantage of the online community and have personal examples of how these interactions have impacted you.\nAs for learning … how does sharing our learning within a community help us achieve our personal and professional goals?\nThere are several social learning theories and practices that explain how social interactions impact our learning (e.g., situated learning, social constructivism, connectivism, cooperative and collaborative learning, communities of inquiry, and so on). If you’re interested, feel free to look these up online or use tools such as LitMaps to explore the research on these theories.\nIn this course we have promoted the use of tools that allow you to share your learning online: Discourse, Hypothes.is, and WordPress. Our goal is to help you utilize technology to discover and share knowledge, collaborate with others, and become engaged digital global citizens. In the next activity, we ask you to reflect on your learning experiences and your goals.\n\n6.1.1 Activity: Learning in Community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch What is Social Learning?
