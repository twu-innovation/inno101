-   If you are connecting to a web-conferencing meeting (Zoom, Teams, etc.) please make sure you are in a quiet place, not a coffee shop or other place with lots of background noise.
    -   If you don't have a quiet place, make sure your mic is muted, and instead use the text chat.

<summary>**Shared Drive, Sharing & Backup**</summary>

[**Data & Cloud Storage and Sharing**](https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1904/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=128533){target="_blank"}

Cloud storage software provides web access to your online file storage, file sharing, and file synchronization. The only TWU approved Cloud Storage & Sharing services are:

-   [Microsoft OneDrive](https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1904/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=71260){target="_blank"}\
-   [Microsoft SharePoint](https://mytwu.sharepoint.com/){target="_blank"}\
-   [OwnCloud](https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1904/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=15681){target="_blank"}

The responsibility for storing TWU documents and files lies with the person who stores the data. Judgment is required about how and where TWU data will be stored.

TWU has a formal Information Security Policy and related Information Security Guidelines. This article provides some additional direction based on this set of policy and guidelines.

Different data is governed by different regulations, laws, agreements, and rules; each requires different means of protection and reporting.

**What about other 3rd party cloud storage solutions (Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, WeChat etc...)?** In general, the use of unauthorized 3rd party cloud storage is not a good idea. TWU provides students, faculty, and staff with the tools needed to collaborate internally and externally. The reasons below elaborate on the reasoning behind this position.

*Lack of Visibility* - Since these software systems are not integrated into our network, there is no way we can retrieve data stored in these systems if a student, employee, or faculty member leaves the institution and fails to disclose the usage of that account, or has it attached to a personal email account. If TWU data are present in those accounts, then it can be easily lost or compromised, which can lead to institutional and legal consequences.

*Lack of Accountability* - There is no way to effectively manage information security if a student, faculty, or staff member is using unauthorized cloud storage. Additionally, there is no way to know if those data have been compromised and no ability for our forensics team to conduct analyses on these data in the event of a security incident.

*Lack of Support* - We don't offer technical support to these services. So, if something goes wrong, is lost or compromised, IT will have no way to help users who have lost data or been locked out of accounts.

*Collaboration* - We each have our own preferences when it comes to the various technologies we like to work with. There is not always a best tool for everyone. However, collaboration becomes more difficult when each individual or department selects there own collaboration platforms, prioritizing individual needs above the whole.

*Student Centred* - We will put students first. These guidelines ensure we are protecting information and ultimately protecting our students. We have been entrusted with a great deal of personal and private information and must ensure the decisions we make are protecting that information.

**How to Share Data** With Microsoft OneDrive and SharePoint, you can securely share files internally and externally. However, it is important to understand the different Data Classification levels and acceptable ways to share your files (Data Protection Guidelines).
