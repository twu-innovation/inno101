### Course Technologies{-}

This course is about learning with technology. Digital literacies are closely linked but not limited to digital skills. Consequently, this course will use a number of different online communication and publishing technologies to support your learning.

#### An open philosophy of inclusion {-}

*Learning with Technology* incorporates a wide range of online technologies and software applications. In this course we want to promote free and open source software because we believe that no learner should be denied access to learning for lack of funds to purchase a proprietary software license.  Nor do we believe that you should be forced to sacrifice your freedoms in software choice.

The course resources and interaction technologies are based entirely on free and open source software and you will be able to complete all the learning activities using open source applications without the need to purchase any software. You are free to use proprietary technology applications of your choice, but you can also use this course to explore and experiment with open technology.

#### Summary of technologies used on this course {-}

The following table provides a summary of the main technologies used in this course.

| **Technology**       | **Details**             |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| [Moodle](https://learn.twu.ca/)      | TWU uses Moodle as our Learning Management System. For LDRS 101, your course notes, assignment instructions, assignment dropboxes will be found in Moodle. Note that some assignments require you to complete your work in WordPress and Discourse.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Course Book  | Course materials are organized into the Course Book tab in Moodle and contain the instructions to guide your learning. Bookmark this page in your browser.  |
| [Discourse](https://twu.discourse.group/)   | Discourse is a free, open source social network which is hosted at <https://twu.discourse.group/> (bookmark this page).  We use Discourse in this course for discussions. Go to the [LDRS101 forums](https://twu.discourse.group/c/ldrs101/10) in Discourse to explore some of the topics you might engage with during this course.       |
| [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)    | Obsidian is a free note-taking and mind-mapping app. We introduce this digital tool early on in the course as you will use it often for your journal reflections, and for your assignments.   |
| [Litmaps](https://www.litmaps.com/) | Litmaps is a web app that you can use to discover and manage resources. In this course you will use Litmaps to build a map of the literature related to topics you want to research.    |
| Zotero | Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research.    |
| [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) | We use Hypothes.is, an open source web-service that enables users to annotate, discuss and share reflections on web site pages on the Internet.   |
| [WordPress](https://create.twu.ca/)    | In Unit 4 we introduce WordPress, a free, open-source platform used to create websites and blogs. Learners are invited to establish their own **personal course blog**. In this way you will retain control over your own data even when the course is finished.  We recommend WordPress as this tool is supported by TWU, but you may use a blogging platform of your choice.      |
| Zoom     | Zoom is a communications platform that allows you to connect via video, audio, phone, or chat. Note the Live version of this course may use Zoom for class sessions. Students are also encouraged to attend Learning Hub workshops via Zoom.    |

<!--

| Course feed          | The [Course feed](https://course.oeru.org/lida101/interactions/course-feed) is a unique feature of OERu courses. Course comments and posts tagged with the course code (LiDA101) on the course forums, your course blog, the resource bank, our social network and [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) will be harvested and incorporated into the live course feed. This is the hub for keeping track of the distributed course interactions on the web. |
| Course resource bank | The [resource bank](https://bookmarks.oeru.org/search.php/all/lida101) is a site used to share web links and summaries of useful resources you find online. We encourage learners to share links publicly with your peers. Remember to vote for links you find useful on the site. Search using the course tag: “LDRS101”   

-->


#### Learn by Doing {-}

Some learners will be familiar with these technologies, while others will be using them for the first time. We use a learn by doing approach and you will be prompted in the course materials when to interact with these different technologies.

Initially the use of different technologies distributed on the web may be confusing. However, this is a course about learning on the Internet and once you have completed this course, you will become a competent user of these online technologies.

Have fun and enjoy the learning experience!
