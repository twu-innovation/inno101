## Digital Citizenship

Before attempting to define digital citizenship, let's consider the concept of citizenship in its own right. In its simplest form, citizenship refers to the rights, privileges, and duties of being a national citizen. However, the concept of being a good citizen encompasses much more, particularly if you think about full engagement as a member of society.

> *Citizenship is a status that is bestowed on those who are full members of a community.* (Marshall, 1950)

### Activity: Reflecting on Digital Citizenship

::: learning-activity
If good citizenship means fulfilling your role as citizen, can you think of five things good citizens do?

-   Consider the following questions while you read the resources below:
    -   In a digital world, is loyalty to your country a necessary component of the definition of good citizenship?
    -   Is education a prerequisite for good citizenship?
    -   In a digital world, what does it mean to be a global citizen? Read the Wikipedia article on [*Global Citizenship Education*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_citizenship_education){target="_blank"} (2024), where learners engage in solving real world problems.
    -   Has the concept of good citizenship changed over time? In what ways?
    -   Does citizenship require active community engagement? Read this post by Kristen Mattson, director of a high school library media center: [*John Dewey Would Hate Your Digital Citizenship Curriculum*](https://drkmattson.wordpress.com/2016/08/03/john-dewey-would-hate-your-digital-citizenship-curriculum/){target="_blank"} (2016). Why has the concept *digital* been linked with *citizenship* or should we drop the word *digital* and just talk about *good citizenship*?
-   Write your thoughts in your journal (using Obsidian or WordPress). Conclude by writing a description of digital citizenship in your own words. (You will need this later for your Digital Citizenship Blog assessment. It does not need to be a scholarly definition---just your personal thoughts on the concept.)
:::

#### Defining Digital Citizenship {.unnumbered}

Defining digital citizenship is not easy because it means different things to different people. It is also a concept which is debated among scholars researching the field.

If you conduct a general search for "digital citizenship" you will find many links referencing resources targeting elementary and high school levels with a focus on safe, skilled, and ethical use of online technology. While these aspects are important, for the purposes of this tertiary-level course, we need to explore the concept of digital citizenship in more detail.

### Activity: Podcast on Digital Citizenship

::: learning-activity
In this activity you will listen to a podcast that focuses on the people dimension of digital citizenship.

-   Meet [Autumm Caines](https://autummcaines.com/){target="_blank"}, associate director of academic technology from the Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching at Capital University, speaking in a podcast with Bonni Stachowiak.

-   Listen to the first 15--20 minutes of this [*Teaching in HigherEd*](https://teachinginhighered.com/podcast/digital-citizenship/){target="_blank"} (2016) podcast on digital citizenship. The podcast introduces aspects of digital citizenship and the learner experience in starting out with engagement with social media.
:::

#### Guiding Framework {.unnumbered}

Caines (2016) provides a useful framework for thinking about digital citizenship:

-   *Digital identities*: that is, who you are online including the identities of others (individuals and organizations)
-   *Digital environments*: specifically the tools and online spaces we use to interact with each other; for example, Facebook, Discourse, X, blogs, forums, and so on.
-   *Interactions*: between these identities and environments

### Activity: Refined Definition of Digital Citizenship

::: learning-activity
The purpose of this activity is to explore the elements of digital citizenship with particular emphasis on those relevant to your academic study.

Read through the following resources in order to refine your own definition of what it means to be a digital citizen.

-   **Online search:**
    -   Read the introductory section of the Wikipedia article [*Digital Citizen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_citizen){target="_blank"} (2024).
    -   Conduct a general search for "definition of digital citizen." Choose the two best definitions and add these to the library of your citation management tool (Zotero or Obsidian),or keep a record for citation purposes.
    -   Locate one recent scholarly definition for "digital citizen." Record the reference for citation purposes. How recent is the reference?
-   **Social media search:**
    -   Explore recent tweets or posts (on X or whichever social media app you prefer) using the following hashtags: #digitalcitizenship, #digiciz, and #digicit. Compile a list of elements relating to the concept of digital citizenship.
-   **Read and identify:**
    -   Read [*Nine Themes of Digital Citizenship*](https://www.digitalcitizenship.net/nine-elements.html){target="_blank"} (2023), and search for other academic articles on digital citizenship using Google Scholar, LitMaps, or the TWU Library.
    -   Generate a table listing the nine elements of digital citizenship and identify a practical example of each element for your academic study. For example:

| **Element** | **Academic Study Example** |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Digital access | Students from low income countries may not have reliable or affordable access to the Internet. |
| Digital commerce |  |
| Digital communication |  |
| Digital literacy |  |
| Digital etiquette |  |
| Digital law |  |
| Digital rights and responsibilities |  |
| Digital health and wellness |  |
| Digital security |  |

-   After completing the steps above, revise your personal description of digital citizenship. Does your new definition differ from your initial description?
-   Share a reflection on this activity by posting either in your blog or on Discourse. For example:
    -   I didn't realize the ... is part of digital citizenship because ...
    -   ... is not particularly relevant for university learners because ...
    -   ... is particularly relevant for university learners because ...
:::

#### Rights and Responsibilities {.unnumbered}

The concept of citizenship encompasses the rights and responsibilities of individuals. We need to consider what rights and responsibilities come with digital citizenship. In this next activity, we explore this topic with particular emphasis on the rights and responsibilities associated with learning in a digital age.

Following the hype of massive open online courses (MOOC) and the New York Times declaring 2012 the "[year of the MOOC](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html){target="_blank"}," a small group of educators drafted *A Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in a Digital Age* (Ng, 2013). This document forms the basis for a course discussion on the rights and responsibilities of digital citizens.

### Activity: Rights and Responsibilities of Digital Citizens

::: learning-activity
-   Conduct a general search for rights and responsibilities of digital citizenship to assist in refining your own list for university online study. Your search is likely to generate many results developed for the school sector, so you need to evaluate whether these rights and responsibilities are appropriate for you.
-   Read the following and then conduct a search through the TWU library for digital rights and responsibilities.
    -   [*A Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in the Digital Age*](https://www.udacity.com/blog/2013/01/a-bill-of-rights-and-principles-for.html){target="_blank"} (2013)
    -   [Digital Rights and Responsibility in Education: A Scoping Review](https://epaa.asu.edu/index.php/epaa/article/view/7899/3340){target="_blank"} (2024)
-   Prepare a table summarizing the primary rights and responsibilities for university learning in a digital age.
-   Drawing on your knowledge and experience, join the discussion on Discourse regarding rights and responsibilities for learning in a digital age at TWU. You can discuss the topical issues listed below or add new ones to the forum. In each case, justify your position, taking opposing views into account.

```         
<!-- deleting 'Bill of Rights' Seeks to Protect Students' Interests as Online Learning Rapidly Expands (2013) & Critique of 'Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in the Digital Age (2013)
@chloe how does this work with Zotero?  Should I delete from the library? 

On another issue - I want to add this video to the beginning of this activity, but the formatting isn't quite working.  please embed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpNeavL0Dfw

- Watch the Your Digital Rights and Responsibilities| Being a Good Digital Citizen

-->
```

**Topical Issues**

-   Should higher education institutions have the right to determine what software applications learners should use for their studies?
-   Data generated by learners belongs to the learners, therefore should they have the right to access their data (for example forum discussion contributions) even after the course is completed?
-   Where legally permissible, should learners have the right to access all course materials without the need to register a password?
-   Others?

We encourage you to reply and to "like" posts on Discourse. Remember to tag your posts using key words to facilitate searches (e.g. digital-rights).
:::

#### Personal and Professional Identity {.unnumbered}

In short, digital citizenship is about being a person on the web. In the previous unit on building your online presence we noted that individuals portray different personas online; for example, personal, academic, and professional.

On the one hand, we need to be careful about what we post online because this can have a negative impact on future career prospects or current employment. We must also be cognizant of the different limitations that various careers place on what can be shared publicly and what needs to stay private. On the other hand, building a strong learning or professional network online is very powerful in staying up to date with new trends and establishing connections with your peers.

In this section, we reflect on the balance between public and private in a digital world, recognizing that this is going to be different for each person depending on their own environments and professional circumstances. We will also explore how like-minded professionals in your field of interest network online.

> The … impact exercised by ICTs is due to at least four major transformations: “the blurring of the distinction between reality and virtuality,” “ the blurring of the distinction between human, machine and nature,” “the reversal from information scarcity to information abundance,” and “the shift from the primacy of stand-alone things, properties, and binary relations, to the primacy of interactions, processes and networks. (Floridi, 2015, p. 2)

### Activity: Professional Online Identity and Digital Citizenship

::: learning-activity
In this activity we will explore professional online identity and networking in the field of your choice.

-   Finally, visit [the LinkedIn help page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a544795){target="_blank"} on finding and joining a LinkedIn group.

**Questions to Consider**

After completing the activities above answer the following questions:

-   How do like-minded professionals in your career or future career, field, or discipline network online (e.g., X, LinkedIn groups, other websites)?

-   What hashtags, if any, are being used for conversations in your chosen field?

-   What are the topical areas of discussion at the moment?

-   How could your field of interest improve professional networking online?

    \<!-- delete bullet point. Delete in Zotero too?

-   Do organizations in your field place restrictions on employees participating in social networks? (See for example *Corporate Social Media Policies: The Good, the Mediocre, and the Ugly* (2010a), and *More Social Media Policies: LA Times, Harvard Law, Microsoft, and Cisco* (2010b)*.*--\>
:::

### Activity: Blog: Professional Online Identity and Digital Citizenship

::: learning-activity
Prepare a short blog post (about 300--400 words) summarizing your findings on professional online networking in your field of interest. Consider the following questions:

-   How do like-minded professionals in your field network online and what do they talk about?
-   What does this mean for your online identity and being a digital citizen?

Feel free to share your blog post with others on Discourse and/or in your professional learning network. Reply and “like” posts on Discourse, using key tag words to facilitate searches (e.g. digital-rights).
:::

### Activity: Blog: My Online Biography

::: learning-activity
In this challenge you are asked to build or update your professional online biography and the "About" page of your course blog.

-   Reflect on the following online personas, target audiences, and how these will impact on the style and voice of the communication medium.

| **Persona**  | **Primary audience**                        |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Personal     | Friends and family                          |
| Professional | (Future) Employers and professional network |
| Academic     | Peer learning network                       |

-   Choose the most appropriate medium for each of your online personas, for example:

| **Persona**  | **Medium example**                                     |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Personal     | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/){target="_blank"} |
| Professional | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/){target="_blank"} |
| Academic     | Learning blog or website                               |

-   Identify one or two professionals from your field of interest who maintain an active web presence and contribute regularly via social media. Explore their respective websites and professional listings as examples.
    -   X (formerly Twitter) is a good place to search for individuals using popular hashtags from your field or area of study, for example, "#highereducation"
    -   Click through to their respective X user page. If they have a personal website listed on the user page visit the site and review their "About" page
    -   Visit their employer's page and try to locate their biography on the employer's website
    -   Search for the user on LinkedIn
    -   Compare the user information on these different sites. Observe how they link to social media account, and vary the style and content presented for the different personas
-   Create or update your professional profile on LinkedIn.
    -   Consult TWU's [*Student Resources* website](https://www.twu.ca/academics/academic-professional-support/centre-calling-career-development/students/student){target="_blank"} (n.d.-b) which includes information about LinkedIn. TWU gives you access to LinkedIn Learning, which includes several great courses and videos, such as [*Rock Your LinkedIn Profile*](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/rock-your-linkedin-profile/connect-to-opportunity-with-linkedin?u=124451074){target="_blank"} (2024).
-   Create or update your "About" page on your learning blog. You may prefer using a more informal style for this page aligned with your own personality and interests. Include links to your professional profile and respective links to social media that you use.
-   Visit the profile pages of your active social media accounts. Update if necessary, providing links back to your main page (for example, the "About" page on your website).
-   Think carefully about information you post publicly and keep a clear distinction between your personal online presence and your professional online persona. Review your privacy settings on your personal account(s).

## Online Communities

In this section we explore the topic of online communities and how we can engage in social media to enhance our learning.

In the early years of the internet there was strong research interest in studying the differences between virtual and real communities. However, in more recent years we have observed a blurring of the boundaries between online and real communities. In [*The Difference Between Online & Real Life Community?*](https://quiip.com.au/is-there-a-definitive-difference-between-online-and-real-life-community/){target="_blank"} Alison Michalk states:

> Community boundaries are blurred to the extent that the Internet is nothing more than a conduit for communication. The Internet is now just another tool that we use to communicate within our various communities. The same as we use mail, telephone and even a car to keep in touch with our friends, family and colleagues. Our ‘real life communities’ are not mutually exclusive from our ‘online communities’ given that it all comes down to implied physical presence. (2013, para. 2)

So how do we join and contribute constructively to these digital communities? If you don't have much experience with online communities, we encourage you to participate in the course forums and become an active member of the TWU online learning community.

#### Research on Online Communities {.unnumbered}

Research on the efficacy of online communities provides insights on selecting productive communities and how to engage. Community contributors can be classified into three types [(Mocus et al 2002)](https://twu.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edb&AN=100369742&site=eds-live&scope=site){target="_blank"}:

1.  Core members are responsible for guiding the development of the community and have usually been involved with the community for a long time. These members have made significant contributions to the community’s evolution and have earned leadership status. Frequently they also play an active role in moderation of the group.
2.  Active members make regular contributions to the community.
3.  Peripheral members occasionally contribute to the discussions and the periods of engagement are short and sporadic. “Lurkers”, that is individuals seeking answers without making contributions, are normally associated with this group. The nature of engagement in a community is influenced by the community’s life cycle stage [(A. Iriberri and G. Leroy 2009)](https://twu.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edscma&AN=edscma.1459356&site=eds-live&scope=site){target="_blank"}:

| **Life cycle stage** | **Characteristics** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Inception stage | Focus is on determining the purpose, codes of conduct, funding and sustainability |
| Creation stage | User-centred design and evolution including issues of privacy, anonymity, open versus closed communications |
| Growth stage | Focus is on community building, for example, recruiting members, growth management, integrating new members, trust building, up-to-date content, interaction support, a few offline and online events and meetings |
| Maturity stage | By this stage a community culture will have emerged with identifiable community leaders. Focus shifts to permeated management and control, recognition of contributions, recognition of loyalty, member satisfaction management and subgroup management. |

Additional factors identified by the research to keep in mind include:

-   *Network cohesion*, that is the overall level of connections indicated by the network density has a positive impact on the core group as well as the success of the community ([Toral et al 2010](https://twu.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edselp&AN=S0950584909001888&site=eds-live&scope=site){target="_blank"})
-   *Network structure*. Successful communities need a critical mass of contributors, however there is no fixed number that determines success. Most communities can expect between 45--90 % of nonactive members, but communities with a strong and experienced core group will have a positive impact on success (Nonnecke & Preece, 2000, as cited in Toral et al., 2009). Moreover, the positive effects of network structure on participation persist irrespective of the life cycle stage of the community, and activity participation influences network structure [(Igl 2014)](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/node?id=1218984){target="_blank"}
-   *Centralization*. Communities with a high degree of centralization and control exert a negative impact on all participation variables [(Igl, 2014)](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/node?id=1218984){target="_blank"}.

#### Practical Implications {.unnumbered}

There are many online communities, and it will be worth your effort in doing a little online research to determine the network cohesion and network structure of the community. You will be able to determine this by reviewing the archive history. Avoid communities with overly centralized control; in the long run, they are not likely to be productive.

When joining an online community try to identify its life cycle stage by scanning the archive of posts. Young communities are likely to be more tolerant of newbie questions, as responses to these questions will provide support resources for new members in the future. It's a good idea to search the forum for your answer before posting a question. Don't be surprised if newbie questions go unanswered in mature communities; they may can even attract curt rebuttals. If you're a longstanding member of the community, post a tactful reply, for example, "Your question has already been answered" and post a link to the appropriate reply.

The best advice when joining a new community is to lurk for a while before introducing yourself so that you can become familiar with the culture and practices of the community. Fill out your profile page on the forum site, rather than posting a biography in the main discussion threads. Of course, if the community is in the creation phase, you may want to play a more active role in building the community and becoming part of the core contributors.

#### Communities of Practice {.unnumbered}

As you continue to reflect on your social network and consider other learning networks to join for personal or professional growth, we want to present another framing of an online community called a *community of practice*.

> A community of practice is a group of people who *"share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly."* (Wenger-Trayner, 2022)

Cognitive anthropologists Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger coined the term community of practice when studying apprenticeships as a learning model---the term referred to the community that acts as a living curriculum. Once the concept was articulated the researchers started to see communities everywhere, even when no formal apprenticeship system existed.

The basic premise behind communities of practice is simple: we all learn in everyday life from the communities in which we find ourselves. Communities of practice are everywhere. Nearly everyone belongs to some community of practice, whether it is through our working colleagues or associates, our profession or trade, or our leisure interests, such as a book club.

Wenger-Trayner (2022) argues that a community of practice is different from a community of interest or a geographical community in that it involves a shared practice: ways of doing things that are shared to some significant extent among members.

#### Characteristics of a Community of Practice {.unnumbered}

According to Wenger-Treyner (2022) there are three crucial characteristics of a community of practice:

1.  **Domain:** A common interest that connects and holds together the community;
2.  **Community:** A community is bound by the shared activities they pursue (for example, meetings, discussions) around their common domain;
3.  **Practice:** Members of a community of practice are practitioners; what they do informs their participation in the community; and what they learn from the community affects what they do.Wenger- Treyner has argued that although individuals learn through participation in a community of practice, more important is the generation of newer or deeper levels of knowledge through the sum of the group activity. If the community of practice is centered around business processes, for instance, this can be of considerable benefit to an organization.

#### Types of Communities of Practice {.unnumbered}

Today, communities of practices are increasingly being used to improve knowledge management and connect people within business, government, education, and other organizations.

The design of the community will look different depending on the purpose and needs of the participants. There are four basic types of communities:

-   **Helping communities** provide a forum for community members to help each other with everyday work needs
-   **Best practice communities** develop and disseminate best practices, guidelines, and strategies for their members' use
-   **Knowledge stewarding communities** organize, manage, and steward a body of knowledge from which community members can draw
-   **Innovation communities** create breakthrough ideas, new knowledge, and new practices

As you reflect on digital practices in university and the workplace, consider how engaging in a community of practice could benefit you as a learner and in your future career.

## Connecting and Learning Through Social Media

### Activity: Mapping My Social Network

::::: learning-activity
Online communities are varied and can be categorized by their purpose: social, academic, professional, and so on. For this activity, we encourage you to consider your purpose in building an online community.

What are your goals?

-   Do you want to connect with TWU peers internationally and in Canada? Is your focus on academic support or building personal relationships? <!-- //todo #17 -->- Are you interested in the communities that relate to your chosen profession? If so, do a quick search for online communities for a career that interests you (e.g., for businesses: [20 Best Online Community Platforms of 2024 (Ranked)](https://www.mightynetworks.com/resources/community-platforms){target="_blank"}).
-   Do you want to engage with online communities that align with your personal interests? (e.g., sports, arts, politics, gardening, coding)
-   Write down your goals for joining an online community. Next, consider the networks you are currently a part of. You may want to refer back to Unit 1 in which you created a Personal Learning Network map.
-   Now, with a focus on networking create your own Social Map. See the following example from [Brian Solis](https://briansolis.com/about/){target="_blank"}, a digital analyst, anthropologist and author.

#### Collaboration and Annotation Tools {.unnumbered}

Another way to join an online community or discussion forum is to annotate the web. Hypothes.is is one tool used at TWU for students to collaborate and discuss online resources.

Hypothes.is an open source platform that allows users to annotate any website, communicate with others, and collaborate with peers.

### Activity: Introduction To Hypothes.is

## Connecting to the TWU Community

Our final topic focuses on the TWU community and how you can participate both online and on campus. As a TWU student you have the opportunity to connect with a diverse student body, faculty, and staff. What role does technology play in how you communicate with your peers, collaborate on projects, and build relationships?

In this unit we have discussed what it means to be a digital citizen and how we can engage with online communities. How does this apply to you as a TWU student? As we wrap up this unit, we encourage you to reflect on your personal and academic goals and how you can engage with the TWU community.

### Activity: TWU's Learning Community

::: {.learning-activity title="Reflect and Engage"}
-   Take a moment to reread the course description for this course:

Introduces theories and competencies related to learning and thriving in a digital world. Explores how learners are situated in “the digital” throughout their lives and how they can use digital technologies to enhance and enrich their experience of learning, working, and playing. Learners will begin to build a curated digital footprint, initiate and develop personal and professional learning networks; develop competencies to allow them to evaluate and choose digital platforms and tools that are safe and ethical; and explore how to use digital technologies to discover, curate, connect, and share knowledge with their communities.

Next, focus on two key course learning outcomes:

-   Develop personal and professional learning networks to discover and share knowledge, collaborate with others, and become engaged digital global citizens.
-   Create inclusive digital communities which embody a sense of belonging, connection, and Christian hospitality.

Finally, take a look at Trinity's [*Life at TWU*](https://www.twu.ca/life-twu){target="_blank"} (n.d.-a) website.

We invite all TWU students to connect, thrive, and serve in a dynamic, Christ-centred learning community where they can develop as maturing disciples, thoughtful global citizens, and compassionate servant leaders. *Experience life and learning here.*

Consider how you might connect, thrive, and serve through your connections and contributions online, and if applicable, on campus.

What experiences have you had so far in connecting with your peers and getting to know the TWU community? If you have not participated in the engagement opportunities presented in this course (Discourse, WordPress blog), take the time now to connect!

**TWU on Social Media**

Here are some other websites you might want to check out for more about the TWU community:

-   TWU Facebook

-   X (Twitter)

-   Instagram

Jot down your responses to the following questions in your reflective journal (Obsidian):

-   What are your personal and academic goals for making connections at TWU?
-   What steps will you take to make those connections?
-   What technology or digital skills will you need to fully engage?
-   How can connecting to the TWU community enhance your understanding of digital citizenship and online networking?
